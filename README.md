- [x] validate css
- [x] get sessions to last longer, or automatically log out so I don't write a bunch and get an unauthorized error when I try to save
- [ ] don't release grades until everyone's has been graded. (so I can implement a curve)
- [ ] send email after grade is marked with my notes and a link.

- [x] Add a Favicion
- [ ] implement a progress report every 3 weeks

- [ ] Make Screencast for workflow
- [ ] Make tutorial for node/js localhost server, php, python.
- [ ] Do several studies on algorithmic art.
- [ ] Implement web-socket interface that reacts to people in course
- [ ] Show who is in attendance in toolbar (header or footer I suppose)
- [ ] Get a diff algorithm to determine how much the code changes between last recorded version.
- [ ] Allow users to change their first name.
- [x] Prioritize grading based on time spent
- [x] Add a flag that indicates absent, which is not necessarily the points awarded.
- [ ] Cover <table>s and <form>s in ASWM
- [ ] Do quiz online.

- [ ] Make an infographic/visualization of the semester to come
- [ ] Add courses/sections to instructor footer
- [ ] show course progress (perhaps as a favicon) in terms of semester and individual classes
- [ ] Write essay explaining how to approach effort in that I'm the client, students are design/development firm (sending broken links bad)

- [ ] Implement basic usage/analytics tracking

- [ ] Parse readme.md files for interactives themselves.
- [ ] **Make a scroll-spy that checks boxes as you continue down outline. Show user analytics as well. Track velocity so
- [ ] When doing a site download/analysis, find images (jpg/png/svg/gif) and do a file size/dimension analysis, generate color-coded FPO replacement.
- [ ] The above replacement should scan CSS files for url(!http) resources as well.
- [ ] Add a way to embed specific sections of articles in outlines
- [ ] Add a tldr; to articles;
** What about an ajax callback that returns an intention. Like, if true, check this box. I suppose this is a promise maybe? That means investigate promises.
