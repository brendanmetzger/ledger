# Pedagogy
A way to Organize my teaching materials,  students and  assignments.

## todo
- [x] add date to emails
- [x] student preview for practice notes
- [ ] improve way to take attendance (like, attendance is noted via a quick quiz or exercise)
- [x] crunch notes into 1 line before saving
- [x] automatically show validation errors
- [x] compute unique tags used
- [x] consider #lines of css & uniqueness.
- [x] validate css
- [x] get sessions to last longer, or automatically log out so I don't write a bunch and get an unauthorized error when I try to save
- [ ] don't release grades until everyone's has been graded. (so I can implement a curve)
- [ ] send email after grade is marked with my notes and a link.
- [x] make icon for wikipedia links.
- [x] Open wikipedia links in a console. Open with API
- [x] Make fixed close button and lock <body> when mouse is scrolling wikipedia content
- [ ] Make an index in the outlines with anchors to each section.
- [ ] Make a 'Panic Protocol' page
- [x] Add a Favicion
- [ ] request that examples/help be done as a gist/codepen/fiddle/gomix
- [ ] Make Screencast for workflow
- [ ] Make tutorial for node/js localhost server, php, python.
- [ ] Do several studies on algorithmic art.
- [ ] Implement web-socket interface that reacts to people in course
- [ ] Show who is in attendance in toolbar (header or footer I suppose)
- [ ] Get a diff algorithm to determine how much the code changes between last recorded version.
- [ ] Allow users to change their first name.
- [x] Prioritize grading based on time spent
- [x] Add a flag that indicates absent, which is not necessarily the points awarded.
- [ ] Cover <table>s and <form>s in ASWM
- [ ] Do quiz online.
- [ ] In the beginning of an outline, say what is due, what was due... ie., a recap of where we are at in the semester
- [ ] Make an infographic/visualization of the semester to come
- [ ] Add courses/sections to instructor footer
- [ ] show course progress (perhaps as a favicon) in terms of semester and individual classes
- [ ] Write essay explaining how to approach effort in that I'm the client, students are design/development firm (sending broken links bad)
- [ ] Change load script to new technique from TCF
- [ ] Compile `<mark>` elements to construct an overview at the end of every lecture outline. (start using `<mark>` elements this way)
- [ ] Implement basic usage/analytics tracking
- [ ] Add a readme for all interactive tidbits
- [ ] Parse readme.md files for interactives themselves.
- [ ] **Make a scroll-spy that checks boxes as you continue down outline. Show user analytics as well. Track velocity.b
- [ ] When doing a site download/analysis, find images (jpg/png/svg/gif) and do a file size/dimension analysis, generate color-coded FPO replacement.
- [ ] The above replacement should scan CSS files for url(!http) resources as well.
- [ ] Add a way to embed specific sections of articles in outlines
- [ ] Add a tldr; to articles;
- [x] Set up glossary/faq controller
- [ ] Add font/size, contrast, and typeface preferences
- [x] Auto generate link to edit file in textmate
- [ ] Flashcards
- [x] hovering a paragraph writes out abbreviations
- [ ] let students change the name of their projects
- [ ] btoa on discourse input


## Priority Items
- [ ] Take screenshots of assignments (http://www.page2images.com/)
- [ ] implement a file history (and analyze deltas)
- [ ] perform analysis to determine if source code is organized 
- [ ] perform analysis to determine if code is of a certain quality
- [ ] determine if code meets min/max SLOC requirements

** What about an ajax callback that returns an intention. Like, if true, check this box. I suppose this is a promise maybe? That means investigate promises.


# TODOs and notes
For student-graded quizzes, create an algorithm that as soon as a student gets a question marke wrong at least once, they start grading quizzes that other students got the answer to wrong. An answer of "I don't know" (or blank) is automatically wrong, so we can eliminate the grading of those right away. 


# Ideas / Examples

- [ ] The slide in message when user scrolls y amount of screen
- [ ] Fix a JSON object riddled with errors (use cuepoints object)
- [ ] Design a page to be scrolled as the interactive element
- [ ] Game of Life on Scroll instead of timer
- [ ] Do a lecture on mapping for ASWM
- [ ] Do a click-here, open-that-over there
- [ ] Loops as 99 bottles of beer on the wall
- [ ] youtube player API


## Warm-ups
```
// refactor
function isEven(value) {
	if (value % 2 == 0) {
    return true;
  }
	else {
    return false;
  }	
}

// 1. based on the above, write a function isOdd
// 2. rewrite the isEven function to be more artilate
// 3. Think about if/why one should write either of these.


- Make a function that is able to compute `[!n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial)`
- Make a function that can compute the [greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) between any two numbers
- Write three functions and randomly call one of them.
- Write an event listener that will only fire once.
```
