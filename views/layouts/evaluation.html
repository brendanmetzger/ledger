    <ol>
      <li>There are <strong>5 projects</strong></li>
      <li>There are <strong>15 weeks</strong> in a semester</li>
      <li>Every project will be critiqued once every <strong>3 weeks</strong>: <var>5 / 15 = 3</var>. A critique sets the maximum score you may receive for a project (<a href="#critique">see below for how that works</a>). Individual projects will not be reviewed past the review date unless special circumstances present themselves.</li>
      <li>Projects accrue points over the course of the semester based on effort and quality—this process is automated and easily achievable with good habits.</li>
      <li>The score for every project is finalized on the last day of the semester—<strong>projects can (must) be improved over the course of the semester to receive full credit</strong>.</li>

    <h2>Reviewing Work</h2>
    <div class="margins three columns">
      <p>Evaluating qualitative aspects of a project is difficult but quite necessary. Careful design must achieve certain level of expectations, and thus, scoring should be meaningful, and more importantly, consequential. That last bit in particular is where critiques often fail, especially in the following two ways. First, novice work is very difficult to discuss using one particular set of goals, and two, when feedback is given, it happens <em>after</em> the project is complete, voiding the opportunity to adjust techniques for a better outcome.</p>
      <p>To combat the first pitfall I have a rubric that increases in expectancy as the course progresses. The rubric itself is a progressive mechanism designed to allow a student at the beginning of the semester to think most about concept and potential, while at the end of the semester to focus on technical details and project management. A successful student has made progress in many areas that help to articulate design work. By the last critique, a student should be delivering work that is better at speaking for itself, and any critique will reflect that positively.</p>

    <figure class="tt">
      <figcaption class="whitepaper">
        <p>There are 10 criteria I use to talk about web development projects. I haven't figured out a good way to show it just yet, so it will have to be understood abstractly. Every critique I will add two more scales to look at, starting with the first two criteria for round one. The remaining eight, I will not deduct anything, but if I think you are doing well in any areas, I will bump up your score. For the next critique, I'll add the next two items ans being above or below average, and give only positive scores for anything I consider above average that remains. By the last critique everything will  be reviewed as potential +/- to your score.</p>
