During my formative years, I spent some time working for a man named Tom on a small farm in Northwest Illinois. By my estimates, Tom, had not really purchased a new item since 1975.

## Work is work

On a farm with cattle it comes as no surprise that the barns need to get shoveled. That is, a mountain of manure piles up, and you, the lowly laborer, shovel it out, scoop by scoop. This is dirty, exhausting work and when I was first starting out I hadn't earned learned how to use the old International Harvester 806 replete with front-end hydraulic loader, so I shoveled all day.

## The value of shoveling.

The analogy sticks. You know the shape of the barn, the corners, and the tight spots. You know the uneven crack in the cement. You know the space of the columns. 

## Your Job

Regardless of how far you get, what technique you employ, you shovel the barn. It might be grueling, it might be easy, it might even be fun. You will exercise parts new muscles and rejoice at the unrivaled awesome feeling of a hard days work, work that not everyone is capable of because they don't have the tenacity or grit to keep at it and finish the job.

## My Job

I am going to teach you how to start that finicky old tractor. Sometimes we spray a little ether into the air intake, or massage the choke valve into it's sweet spot. You aren't going to know everything about this old beast – I certainly don't, but we'll get it running and make our work easier and have some fun.
