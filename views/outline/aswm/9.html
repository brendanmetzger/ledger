    <h2>Drawing and Animation</h2>
    <p class="intro">I've arbitrarily picked <q>drawing and animation</q> as an important topic because really, it presents an opportunity to learn both new material and hone already-learned skills. Truthfully, working with <abbr>SVG</abbr> and canvas can be a bit difficult; concerning the former, it can be especially difficult without a framework.</p>
    <div class="three columns indented">
      <p>While you can draw with <abbr>SVG</abbr> or canvas, it will be worth understanding the difference between the two. Fundamentally, <abbr>SVG</abbr> is a vector format, canvas is raster, which isn't that important, but I will propose you start with <abbr>SVG</abbr> for a few other reasons. First, <abbr>SVG</abbr> is a file format, so you can use a drawing program such as Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape to draw, save, and embed files as images. Second, the file format is actually  <abbr>XML</abbr>, and it's important to underscore how interesting that is.  <abbr>XML</abbr> can be embedded directly into your document, meaning it becomes a part of the Document Object Model. You can query elements with JavaScript, and style elements with <abbr>CSS</abbr>, which is extremely useful. For these reasons alone, I think it's a great starting point. Canvas starts to outshine when you are embedding other raster and time based media (images and video), and applying filters and intense scene rendering and calculation—essentially games.</p>
      <p>Jumping right in and writing all of your own <abbr>SVG</abbr> can be daunting—there are issues with both intense  <abbr>XML</abbr> and as well as a foreign drawing <abbr>API</abbr> to contend with. For that, I will suggest using a framework, such as  <a href="http://snapsvg.io/">Snap</a>, as a starting point to working with <abbr>SVG</abbr>. This is both good on how to read an <abbr>API</abbr> and learning about drawing in 2d cartesian space.</p>
      <p>Before you begin with that, you must understand a little bit about <abbr title="scalable vector graphics">svg</abbr> itself. Here is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial">a tutorial</a> from the Mozilla Developer Network—I'd suggest starting with the <em>introduction</em> and reading up through <em>Fills and Strokes</em>. Here is another tutorial called <a href="http://svgtutorial.com/">Up and Running with <abbr>SVG</abbr></a>—I think browsing up through chapter 12 is relevant material. Here is the <abbr title="world wide web consortium">W3C</abbr> <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/svg/default.asp"><abbr>SVG</abbr> tutorial</a>.</p>
      <p>There is a glut of material on Lynda.com regarding <abbr>SVG</abbr>, with topics ranging from Adobe Illustrator to responsive design and of course programming. Browse that material to see if it interests you (especially while you still have access).</p>
