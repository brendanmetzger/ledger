    <h2>Prototypes</h2>
    <p class="intro">JavaScript is a <em>prototypal language</em>, which is also known as class-less or instance-based programming. Unlike class-based languages that define relationships in a familial way (inheritance, parents, traits), prototypal languages share their genes by <em>cloning prototypes</em>.</p>
    <p>It is a rather peculiar concept, but objects have a property called the <code>prototype</code> and objects can copy each others prototypes. A fascinating (and sometimes dangerous) technique, is that because there are no classes, if you happen to change a prototype of an object, it changes the prototype or <em>all</em> objects that share itâ€”even if they existed long before the change was made.</p>
