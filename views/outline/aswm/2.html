    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>All of the code examples above as well as last week’s exercises <a class="read" href="/javascript/examples/functions.js">can be viewed here</a>. Jumping to exercises, you’ll see my solutions. Beginning programmers exhibit similar struggles around topics of program flow (especially logic) so I want to introduce my own personal mantra: while you code, <strong>imagine conditions (though quite necessary) as poisonous, and every time you nest a condition, you’re doubling the potency of the poison</strong>. Maybe that seems crazy now, but as you continue to advance, no matter the language, there are facilities that allow you to <mark>avoid writing all but the most trivial conditions</mark>. In functional programming these are fancy things like Functors and Monads. In Object Orientation, these are principles of polymorphism and usage of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Design Patterns</a>. For beginners, this is looking at logic as a puzzle and trying to whittle down a complex task to the <mark>fewest conditions possible</mark>.</p>
