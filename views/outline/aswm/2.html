    <p class="intro">Functions are largely about encapsulating process. Sometimes that means breaking down a much bigger routine into smaller, more manageable chunks. Other times it simply defines a set of instructions that must be repeated at often or at unknown times.</p>

    <h3>Warming up</h3>
    <p>We understand types and flow of control with loops and conditions. Moving forward I've devised a few examples to showcase some areas for you to focus on in the near future.</p>
    
    <h4 class="tt">Part One</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Define a containing Element</li>
      <li>Place 5-10 Elements in the containing Element</li>
      <li>Each of the 5-10 elements should be the full height of the viewport</li>
      <li>Add one more additional Element after the containing Element—as a sibling</li>
      <li>Give that last element a class attribute of <samp>hidden</samp>, and hide the element</li>
    </ol>
    <h4 class="tt">Part Two</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Give each of the 5-10 elements a random background color from an array of background colors. There should be the same number of background colors in the array as there are Elements in your container.</li>
      <li>research the properties <code>scrollTop</code>, <code>scrollY</code>, <code>scrollHeight</code> and <code> innerHeight</code>—note which or what sort of object those properties belong to.</li>
      <li>Add an event listener to monitor page scroll and observe that behavior</li>
      <li>Calculate the percentage you have scrolled</li>
      <li>if the user has scrolled a reasonable percentage, remove the <samp>hidden</samp> class attribute of the element that has that attribute.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Reference &amp; Practice Material</h3>
    <p><q>Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming</q>—or so says <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html">Chapter Three</a> of <cite>Eloquent JavaScript</cite>. Confirm that statement by reading that Chapter. If you have yet to read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html">Chapter Two</a>, do not delay, <mark>there will be quiz soon</mark> to help me determine if you are taking the reading seriously.</p>
    <p>In <cite>JavaScript, The Definitive Guide</cite> read <strong>Chapter Four</strong> on constructing statements and then skim through <strong>Chapter Eight</strong> on functions and become familiar-ish—I will be talking about most of the material in that chapter as the course progresses.</p>
