    <h2>The Web Development Workflow</h2>
    <p>Today’s lecture is titled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place">mis en place</a>, a French culinary phrase which means <q>everything in its place,</q> because it is the one thing every student can <strong>easily</strong> achieve that will guarantee a positive impact in any profession involving precision and craft. Having the proper resources and tools (and learning their correct usage) will both reduce the amount of mistakes and increase the amount of joy you feel with your efforts. I sincerely promise, learning a few tools efficiently will change the trajectory of your time in front of a computer forever.</p>
    <h3 class="tt">The Web Designer/Developers Fundamental<sup>*</sup> Toolkit</h3>
    <p class="note"><sup>*</sup> Mind, I say fundamental for a reason—there are many more tools you are likely become familiar with, ranging from media and graphics editors, to online tools, to reference materials and tutorial sites.</p>
    <ul class="whitepaper">
      <li>A text editor, or more accurately, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_editor">Source Code Editor</a></li>
      <li>A modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser">web browser</a> (I suggest Google Chrome as it will be used in class and to evaluate all coursework)</li>
      <li>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol"><abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> Client</a></li>
      <li>The <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools">Web Development console</a>; built into modern browsers and we will use the hell out of it.</li>
      <li>The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Validators (<a href="https://validator.w3.org/">Markup</a> and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">Cascading Style Sheets</a>)</li>
      <li>Awareness of documentation and resources (Such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">The Mozilla Developer network</a> [preferred] and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>)</li>
      <li>Typing profiency (or practice if needed), and the learning of keyboard shortcuts.</li>
      <li>Understanding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_documentation">Software Documentation</a> <em>Documentation is very much a tool</em>, and reading and writing it are skills to acquire.</li>
      <li>As far as this class is concerned, ake sure you poke around <a href="https://www.lynda.com/">Lynda.com</a>—I'll reference it frequently. I watch it myself quite a bit and you should too!</li>

    <h2>Techniques for success in this class</h2>
    <p>All of the techniques I am presenting come from professional experience on how to complete projects—especially on small teams where you have a great deal of personal responsibility. This is such a common phenomenon for developers and professionals to develop their skills that they coined the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_hack">life hacking</a> to describe it.</p>

      <h3>Understand Parkinsons Law</h3>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson's Law</a> is essentially an observation on the inability for deadlines to be met efficiently, especially when applied to larger organizations.</p>

      <h3>The Tomato (Pomodoro) Technique</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> is a way to plan for short, specific, focused spurts of work. Pomodoro means tomato in Italian (you can read the backstory on your own) and I have a version suited to this class.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Decide on a <em>research-based</em> task to be done.</li>
        <li>Set a timer (traditionally to 25 minutes)</li>
        <li>Work on the task until the timer rings. If a distraction pops into your head, write it down, but immediately get back on task.</li>
        <li>After the timer rings, take a short break, grab a snack or beverage, stretch, walk about, etc. (3-5 min)</li>
        <li>Decide on a new <em>code-based</em> task (something from your research perhaps) to practice</li>
        <li>Set a timer (again, for 25 minutes)</li>
        <li>When the timer rings, you're done. Continue to jot down any distractions, or write down any goals for next time.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now, this is perhaps the most crucial part. Your effort is time-boxed, that is, you can accomodate your schedule for little bits of work here and there. You will all of a sudden have an agenda and know what to work on next time you sit down. But, and this is important, the key for this technique to work is that you are going to employ it routinely. <strong>I recommend for times per week for success in this medium</strong>.</p>

      <h3>The Early Bird Technique</h3>
      <p>My personal tact—wake up early, focus on tasks you've thought about, end your computer day at noon. Spend the rest of the day exploring, reading, and noting what you'd like to do tomorrow.</p>
