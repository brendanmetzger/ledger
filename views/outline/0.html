    <h2>The Web Development Workflow</h2>
    <p>Today's lecture is titled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place">mis en place</a>, a French culinary phrase which means <q>everything in its place,</q> because it is the one thing every student can <strong>easily</strong> achieve that will guarantee a positive impact in any profession involving precision and craft. Having the proper resources and tools (and learning their correct usage) will both reduce the amount of mistakes and increase the amount of joy you feel with your efforts. I sincerely promise, learning a few tools efficiently will change the trajectory of your time in front of a computer forever.</p>
    <h3 class="tt">The Web Designer/Developers Fundamental<sup>*</sup> Toolkit</h3>
    <p class="note"><sup>*</sup> Mind, I say fundamental for a reason—there are many more tools you are likely become familiar with, ranging from media and graphics editors, to online tools, to reference materials and tutorial sites.</p>
    <ul class="whitepaper">

      <li>Awareness of documentation and resources (Such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">The Mozilla Developer network</a> [preferred] and <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>)</li>
      <li>Typing profiency (or practice if needed), and the learning of keyboard shortcuts.</li>
      <li>Understanding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_documentation">Software Documentation</a> <em>Documentation is very much a tool</em>, and reading and writing it are skills to acquire.</li>
