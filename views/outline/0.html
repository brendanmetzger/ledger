    <h2>Techniques for success in this class</h2>
    <p>All of the techniques I am presenting come from professional experience on how to complete projects—especially on small teams where you have a great deal of personal responsibility. This is such a common phenomenon for developers and professionals to develop their skills that they coined the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_hack">life hacking</a> to describe it.</p>

      <h3>Understand Parkinsons Law</h3>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law">Parkinson's Law</a> is essentially an observation on the inability for deadlines to be met efficiently, especially when applied to larger organizations.</p>

      <h3>The Tomato (Pomodoro) Technique</h3>
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a> is a way to plan for short, specific, focused spurts of work. Pomodoro means tomato in Italian (you can read the backstory on your own) and I have a version suited to this class.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Decide on a <em>research-based</em> task to be done.</li>
        <li>Set a timer (traditionally to 25 minutes)</li>
        <li>Work on the task until the timer rings. If a distraction pops into your head, write it down, but immediately get back on task.</li>
        <li>After the timer rings, take a short break, grab a snack or beverage, stretch, walk about, etc. (3-5 min)</li>
        <li>Decide on a new <em>code-based</em> task (something from your research perhaps) to practice</li>
        <li>Set a timer (again, for 25 minutes)</li>
        <li>When the timer rings, you're done. Continue to jot down any distractions, or write down any goals for next time.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Now, this is perhaps the most crucial part. Your effort is time-boxed, that is, you can accomodate your schedule for little bits of work here and there. You will all of a sudden have an agenda and know what to work on next time you sit down. But, and this is important, the key for this technique to work is that you are going to employ it routinely. <strong>I recommend for times per week for success in this medium</strong>.</p>

      <h3>The Early Bird Technique</h3>
      <p>My personal tact—wake up early, focus on tasks you've thought about, end your computer day at noon. Spend the rest of the day exploring, reading, and noting what you'd like to do tomorrow.</p>
