    <h2>Think</h2>
    <p class="intro">Your final project is going to be an endeavor, so your last bit of practice for the semester will be an opportunity to spend time thinking about it in a way that proves you have thought about it.</p>
    <p>Consider this a proposal. Our medium is web development, so you will transmit ideas to me in <abbr>html</abbr>, <abbr>css</abbr>, and JavaScript. Communication is of paramount importance, so the better you are able to outline your concept now, the better our discussion about it will be next week. You will have a full <strong>three weeks</strong> to do work towards your finalâ€”now is the time to evaluate your goals, strengths, and weaknesses..</p>
    <h3 class="tt">The Requirements</h3>
