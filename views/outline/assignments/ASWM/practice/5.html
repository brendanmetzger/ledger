    <h2>An Easy Challenge</h2>
    <p class="intro">Your understanding of JavaScript is increasing, it will be beneficial to practice conventions and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactoring</a>. The trick here is that you will be writing a program and next week someone else will take your program and try to refactor it.</p>
    <p>The outline pointed you to a resource that talks about how JavaScript is typically written.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>do not</em> comment your code</li>
      <li><em>do not</em> write notes explaining how it works.</li>
      <li><em>do</em> read through the article on naming conventions</li>
      <li><em>do</em> use <abbr title="xml http request">XHR</abbr>/<abbr>AJAX</abbr> at least once to load some kind of content.</li>
      <li>Really make a concerted effort to write a script around 100 lines tops, 50 lines minimum.</li>
      <li>Code need not be profound or even interesting, but next week's assignment depends on this one; let that be a motivating force.</li>
    </ul>
