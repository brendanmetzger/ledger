  <h2>HTML, the <span style="text-decoration:line-through">most cryptic</span> best way possible</h2>
  <p class="intro pad">This weeks practice will be self-directed to some degree. I've provided a lot of links that you should research and get a feel forâ€”the outline is barely the tip of the iceberg. With your references open, you should then begin to practice things. You may choose to refactor code you previously wrote, or you may have to write new code, but I want you to focus on the following tasks.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Try to create a decently complicated html fragment using nothing but the <abbr>dom</abbr> <abbr>api</abbr>: <code>document.createElement</code>, <code>Element.appendChild</code>, etc.</li>
    <li>Play around with adding events to Elements you query from the document.</li>
    <li>Work with input elements;they have additional event types such as <em>input, change, focus and blur</em></li>
    <li>Begin understanding how the document loads; you should be utilizing <code>window.addEventListener('load', <em>fun...</em>);</code>.</li>
    <li>Try adding events to Elements you've created with <code>document.createElement</code> (this is where things get interesting!)</li>
    <li>Use <code>preventDefault()</code> in something. A great example: say you have a list of links and you want them to open in a new tab. How might you use querySelector to grab every link, assign an event listener, and open that link in a new window when the link is clicked?</li>
    <li>Though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code">lines of code</a> is a strange thing to ask for, I'm going to ask for it. Write at least 100 lines of code, the more the merrier!</li>
  </ul>
