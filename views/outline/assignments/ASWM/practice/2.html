    <h2>(Re)Learning The DOM</h2>
    <p>Lynda.com has a lot of great videos, and I think you should watch a few chapters of the <em>JavaScript Essential Training</em> course. Start at chapter 4, <a class="watch" href="http://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/What-DOM/81266/87536-4.html">Understanding the DOM</a> and watch all the way through chapter 5. The fundamental take away is the transition from using <code>elem.innerHTML</code> to inserting and manipulating the DOM programmatically using things like <code>document.createElement</code>—a <strong> powerful technique</strong>. You’ll make use of some of these skills in the practice below</p>

    <h2>A new way of thinking.</h2>
    <p>Programming JavaScript like another procedural or object oriented language (which lot’s of tutorials do) misses the point a bit. You certainly can do it that way, but the part that has no translation, as we got a taste of today, is the way JavaScript uses functions. Mastery of functions will precipitate the joy of someday yelling <em>En gaurde!</em> and <em>Touché!</em> (I believe those are fencing terms). So this weeks assignment is to write a bunch of functions. If you need a refresher on the topic, don’t hesitate to check out Lynda.com. There are many courses on JavaScript—even an entire course <a href="http://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/JavaScript-Functions/148137-2.html">on functions</a> (not required).</p>

        <p>In <code>practice/2/scripts/practice-2.js</code> start writing code. Remember, all your code for this course must be in the files I created for you. Front-end design and navigation is up to you, but the starting point must always be the <code>index.html</code> file for the assignment, CSS must be in <code>styles/practice-#.css</code> and JS must be in <code>scripts/practice-#.js</code>. As for the functions, <strong>take note:</strong> Try and make these functions meaningful. From a boilerplate syntax perspective, it’s quite easy to just <q>write a function</q> that fits this criteria, but I want you to stretch your mind a bit and think about the context of the scenario and why you might write a function in each particular style.</p>
        <p>If you need extra challenge, try to write all these functions as a program that work in conjunction with one another—it’s definitely possible! You can write some additional functions if necessary, but don’t go crazy, we're shooting for cleverness and austerity.</p>
        <p>Lastly, when you finish your functions, <strong>write some documentation for the code</strong> you wrote on your index page. I’ll read that documentation and try to execute your functions from the console, so you need to tell me how your stuff works. And for those of you who need to get your design practice in, it wouldn’t hurt to make it informative and beautiful!! And don’t forget about that readme. </p>

        <dd>The function should take some data input, perhaps an array or an object</dd>
        <dd>The function should <code>return</code> a function capable of acting on that input. (this is closure)</dd>
        <dt>Declare a function that takes a function as an argument</dt>
        <dd>The function should take at least 2 arguments</dd>
        <dd>One of the arguments should be data</dd>
        <dd>The function argument should operate on the data.</dd>
        <dd><code>return</code> the modified data</dd>
        <dd><strong>Note</strong> while this one may seem absurd, <em>it’s a very common pattern</em> that I’ll outline in an example next week.</dd>

        <dd><strong>insert</strong> the new element <strong>before</strong> to the old </dd>
        <dd><strong>remove</strong> the original element</dd>
        <dd><code>return</code> the newly created element</dd>
        <dd>There is an easier way to do this, but I’m interested in this, <em>the hard way</em>!</dd>
