  <h2>Fencing vs. Ping-Pong</h2>
  <section class="indented">
    <p>As I've continued to see the various growth and difficulties of those learning JavaScript, I'm ever more confused as to whether it's  a good beginner language or a terrible as a beginner language. It's easy to do the usual stuff—variables, loops, conditions, declare a function. It can be argued that it's easier than C#, Python because you just crack open <em>any browser</em> and you have an interpreter. Take that one thing away though, I've come to the conclusion that the important JavaScript-y parts are incredibly difficult (events, async behavior).</p>
    <p>Now to compare it to something like CSS; something like ping-pong. You can become a phenomenal ping-pong player over time, but you can also have a pretty great time with it from swat #1: the mechanics of are easy to pick up on and mistakes aren't terribly dangerous. CSS makes things way better right away and half the time you mess up, it really doesn't matter at all. I see lot's of students are on the trajectory to become CSS greats.</p>
    <p>Now JavaScript is like fencing. A bout lasts 3 seconds, it's abstract, it's all about finesse and to a beginner, 90% of it is met with <q>WTF?</q> Mistakes are not forgiven, there are a thousand ways to do seemingly the same thing, and becoming good takes what seems like too much study and it isn't that fun–at least not to begin with.</p>

    <h2>A new way of thinking.</h2>
    <p>Programming JavaScript like another language, which lot's of tutorials do, completely misses the point. You certainly <em>can do that</em>, but the part that has no translation, as we got a taste of today, is the way JavaScript uses functions. Mastery of functions will precipitate the joy of someday yelling <em>En gaurde!</em> and <em>Touché!</em> (I believe those are fencing terms). So this weeks assignment is to write a bunch of functions. Your laundry list is below.</p>
    <section class="container">
      <p class="____ float left pad note rag-left">In <code>practice/2/scripts/practice-2.js</code> start writing code. Remember, all your code for this course must be in the files I created for you. Front-end design and navigation is up to you, but I need thes files fore every practice: <code>index.html</code>, <code>styles/practice-#.css</code> and  <code>scripts/practice-#.js</code>. Don't forget about that readme. When you finish your laundry list, <strong>write some documentation for the code</strong> you wrote—I'll want to use most of your functions from the console, so you need to tell me how your stuff works!</p>
      <dl class="______ float left pad">
        <dt>Declare a function that takes only one argument.</dt>
        <dd>If more than one argument is given, <code>throw</code> an error.</dd>
        <dt>Declare a function that returns another function</dt>
        <dt>Declare a function that takes function as an argument</dt>
        <dt>Declare a function that has access to a scoped variable (closure)</dt>
      </dl>
