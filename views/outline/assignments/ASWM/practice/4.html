  <h2>More Practice</h2>
  <p class="intro">Again, some self-directed work. Using the references of your choosing, and this week’s lecture topics, you should have a few ideas sparked or things you’re interested in trying.</p>
  <ul class="pad">
    <li>Try to incorporate the <code>Date</code> object; were you to design a class schedule from your profile.js course listing, you should have many of the skills necessary at this point.</li>
    <li>You've seen an example of <code>setInterval</code> and I've drawn a simple clock and provided enough code to make it tick. You could make your own clock using <code>setInterval</code> and <code>Date</code> (ask why you need <code>Date</code> if it doesn’t immediately occur.)</li>
    <li>It will be beneficial to introduce yourself to methods of amending your html with data, and investigate ways to make program state persist by researching topics like data attributes and localStorage.</li>
    <li>Functions can be simple and small, remember that going forward.</li>
    <li>Again, shoot for around 100 lines of code, if you need more, that’s Ok... but shoot for 100.</li>
  </ul>
