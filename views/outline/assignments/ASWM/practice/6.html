    <h2>Exchange</h2>
    <p class="intro">Last week you wrote a little program, uncommented, employing formatting techniques. This week, you'll simply take two other programs, written by a course-mate, and <em>refactor</em> that code.</p>
    <p>The takeaway here is I want you to learn what reading someone else’s code is like. Can you both read someone else’s code <em>and improve it</em> in some way? Likewise, will someone be able to read and understand your code? Mind, <q>improve</q> is very subjective—it could mean making it more legible, clarifying obscure points through rewriting code, optimizing inefficient algorithms, or if you want, adding a feature or two.</p>

      <h4>Pick Two</h4>
      <p class="focus t b">Below is a link to every classmate’s practice file. Your job: review them, and <strong>pick two</strong> that you think can or will be able to understand and improve in some way. In your practice-6.js, include the two original versions, and each revision. To include two versions of the same code, consider namespacing/sandboxing (advanced), or just comment out the original version if you don’t want to mess around with that. If you need to author new <abbr>HTML</abbr> html or <abbr>CSS</abbr> to make or understand how the code works, by all means, <strong>please do</strong>!</p>

    <h3>The rest of the semester</h3>
    <p>I've also put some thoughts into where we should be spending our energy as many in this room are finishing up their college career. So I propose this the following. <strong>Graduating folk</strong>, I think the rest of the semester you should engage yourself with a big project, and work towards it every week. <strong>Non-graduating folk</strong>, I think you should pick a front-end discipline with a lot of crossover (like SVG), to occupy your efforts and try to build up a strong understanding of concepts that will help you greatly in the coming semesters before matriculation. Together, we will use the majority of class time as a forum to work through problems together.</p>
    <h3>Concepts to focus on</h3>
    <p>As web developers and program designers, there is plenty of craft to be honed, and practice to do. While I want you very much to work towards a big project, I also want you to practice techniques every week, and use your practice area to explore smaller ideas that can be picked apart and shared with everyone. Here is some stuff that I thought we would cover, but I'm going to leave it up to you to see if it fits in with work you are trying to do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Function Binding</li>
      <li><code>this</code> and object prototypes</li>
      <li>Topics in functional programming (map/reduce/filter)</li>
      <li>Frameworks and <abbr>HTML5</abbr> <abbr>API</abbr>s</li>
    </ul>
