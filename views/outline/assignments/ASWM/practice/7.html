    <h2>A second chance</h2>
    <p class="intro">Pick out something you did earlier in the semester (or ever) and make it better.</p>
    <p>Last week you looked at other code and attempted to figure it out and make it better; the takeaway being that writing code that other people can understand is a valuable skill. Likewise, rewriting your own code to be better is a valuable skill, and applying new techniques to older ideas can have surprisingly fruitful results.</p>
    <ol class="whitepaper t b">
      <li>Pick out something to work on</li>
      <li>If it is a long program, try to make it more condensed/eloquent</li>
      <li>If it is a short program, consider making it more robust through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)">encapsulation</a> and careful use of data structures.</li>
      <li>Have you successfully used <code>this</code> binding yet?</li>
      <li>Can you utilize <abbr>XHR</abbr> and <abbr>JSONP</abbr>?</li>
      <li>Are you consistently/meaningfully naming variables?</li>
      <li>Are you quite clear what a first-class function is?</li>
      <li>Event listeners are understood.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="focus">Your final practice work next week will likely center around prep for your final project. Start considering your options, you final will be evaluated on how well it stands on its own.</p>
