    <h2>In-class work</h2>
    <p>Chapter 2 of <em>Eloquent Javascript</em> has <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html#h_TcUD2vzyMe">some exercises</a> that will be good to work through. The examples are <em>Looping a Triangle</em>, <em>FizzBuzz</em>, and <em>Chess Board</em></p>
    <p>Once you have them all solved, upload the sample programs to your practice/1/ folder and make them known to me in some fashion that communicates that fact to me. If you have time, consider amending the code to use something other than the console and add some styles. For instance, how would you make an equilateral triangle with CSS and HTML and # signs.</p>
    <p>If you still have more time, begin reading, help your peers, or work on some sketches and global CSS for your IAM course template.</p>

    <h2>For Next Week</h2>
    <h3>Moving Forward...</h3>
    <p>Now that your course site has (hopefully) been set up, you can manipulate the HTML and CSS as you like. Before you do, there are some things I want you to be hyper-critical of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not delete any files, the basic course structure (<abbr>html</abbr>, <abbr>css</abbr>, js) must remain intact so I can find your assignments without you having to go out of your way to submit anything.</li>
      <li>If you <b>add files</b>, make that clear through links on your index page and additions to sitemap.xml.</li>
      <li>Keep your HTML, JS, and CSS as organized as possible. Run your html through a validator if you think it might be broken. Always close your empty tags (<code>img</code>, <code>link</code>, <code>br</code>, etc.), and make sure assets always have the correct path.</li>
      <li>Maintain a global stylesheet and global css file that you use in every project (it should already be linked). The goal is to work on programs incrementally, so hopefully extra effort in some weeks will continue to benefit you in the long term.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Practice</h3>
    <p>In your course folder locate <code>data/profile.js</code> and fill it out. I have slugged it out with some starting points, but look over the fields and see if you might be able to add any additional ones. Try to think of it in the context of a bigger dataset, like what would be interesting to know about the entire class. What if we used all of the profiles together? An infographic of what our schedules look like, our majors, etc.</p>
    <p>For next week, you should have a nice object created that is your profile. At the start of next weeks class, we will be using that profile to start playing with javascript in a realistic way. To let me know you have filled out your profile.js, see if you can use some of the data in that object in project/1/index.html using DOM Manipulation.</p>

    <h2>Some Reading Material</h2>
    <p>Eloquent JavaScript is a challenging read, but I like it because it is written as a narrative and uses creative code samples, which is where we want to get (eventually). I'll concede that sometimes it can seem pretty complicatied, so for a more straight-forward look at all of the material covered today, you can visit some of the links outlined below from the <em>You Don't know JS</em> series.</p>
