    <p class="intro">For your homework to be graded, you must provide an original README.txt file (there is one in your template). In that readme, the following information is provided.</p>
    <ol class="">
      <li>Indicate the time you spent on the project, in hours *</li>
      <li>Ask at least one question regarding an obstacle or curiosity you encountered while working</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="pad note legal"><sup>*</sup> <strong>I recommend at least five hours (more preferable)</strong>. Often it is difficult for me to determine if poor quality work comes from struggle or procrastination. Please do not exaggerate this number to impress me; I would consider it a breach of trust to ask for more of my time if you aren't being truthful about yours. With the material, there are never explicitly right or wrong answers or a specific agenda, nor do I grade your work in a mechanical fashion. I could structure this class like math or any other technical medium; incorrect is incorrect, do problems 1-9. I have decided to be much more liberal because I think it encourages learning for those interested in learning. The downside is that it takes quite a bit of my time.</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Study_(art)">Artistic studies</a> are essentially sketches done in preparation for a finished work. In this course, we use <em>studies</em> to show me you are considering the principles of the course without the burden of an expectation for a finished product or expected outcome. Incorporate the learning into your semester-long project. Use this work to add new stuff, try ideas and constantly <strong>move forward</strong>.</p>
    <p>Practice and self directed study are going to be where you gain the vast majority of skills in life. Inability to practice the course material will have a negative effect on your creativity and talent stay persistant.  I hope everyone will find the material challenging at some point in this clase, so embrace the challenge and in time you will start to enjoy it. Conversely, if you don’t find the material challenging, read <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3060947/six-habits-of-people-who-confuse-ego-with-self-confidence">this article about the problem with confidence</a>.</p>

    <li>ME: Provide environment suitable to asking questions and dialogue. YOU: ask questions and engage in dialogue.</li>
    <li>Work through confusion: jot down what you are stuck on and bring it to class and we'll discuss—if you are stuck, someone else is too.</li>
    <li>I will kid around with this throughout the semester; familiarize yourself with the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM"><abbr title="Read the f-ing manual">RTFM</abbr></a></li>
    <li>Start early, start often. Backup your work. Procrastination and sloppiness has an oddly strong corollary with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law">Murphy’s Law</a>, ie. <q>my computer exploded the night before the final and I lost everything!</q></li>
    <li class="discuss">Avoid emailing late the night before something due. I don't want you be stressed out, please don't stress me out.</li>
    <li>Not <q>getting an assignment</q>—I understand that.  If you don’t know what I’m asking and it is keeping you from getting started, go your own direction and show you are practicing so you don't fall behind—I can be flexible as long as the effort is there.</li>
