    <h4>Remember</h4>
    <p>Practice and Projects and self directed study are supremely valuable. Inability to get through the material will become an issue as the course progresses, so don’t fall behind.</p>
    <p>Everyone at some point will find the material challenging, so embrace the challenge and don’t deny yourself the opportunity to succeed. Also, if you don’t find <strong>any</strong> of the material challenging, I predict you are in a high-risk situation; you aren’t trying hard enough and there will be consequences. If you aren’t challenged, please speak with me immediately.</p>

    <dt>Questions</dt>
    <dd>You should have them. <em>Lots of them</em>. don’t stop working on something because you think you don’t get it. Write down what you are stuck on and move along to another topic or try another thing.</dd>
    <dd>They should be specific and should indicate some level of understanding with the concept. Asking a very broad (or google-able) question is hard to appreciate.</dd>
    <dt>Scheduling</dt>
    <dd>Start earlier. Week by week we will advance through new, sometimes confusing material. Thinking you’ll remember and get it later will bring out the worst of Murphy’s Law for you. Something crashes, you lose a file, you actually don’t remember what the assignment was, <strong>it’s on you</strong>.</dd>
    <dd>Emailing late at night before something is due is a bad idea. I won’t have the time or energy to give you proper help. It is stressful for <em>you and I both</em>, and if you have a habit that causes stress, it’s a habit you must break.</dd>
    <dt>Confusion</dt>
    <dd>Not <q>getting an assignment</q> is understandable, but it is no reason to pack it in. If you don’t know what I’m asking and you don’t feel like getting to the bottom of it with me or a peer, find another (applicable) way to show you are practicing.</dd>
    <dd>Your course template gives you the structure to move forward. If you are reading a lot and practicing the material and you can show me that in your template, then ask if you can go your own direction with an assignments.</dd>
