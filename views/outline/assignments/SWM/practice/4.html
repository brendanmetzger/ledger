    <h2>Describing Data</h2>
    <p class="intro">This week you're going to watch more JS videos, but from a new author. Some of the material will be revisited, but this will highlight an important concept. Further, this week's practice, and likely the remaining practice assignments, I'm asking that your work be more self-directed. The outline has introduced a generous amount of new material, so you can work your way through it and start picking out what you think you should be focusing on. Likewise, I'll review that work and offer suggestions and critiques from a programming perspectiveâ€”I think this will be the most helpful to suit each student's different needs.</p>

      <h2>What to Learn</h2>
      <div class="______ float left">
        <p>Now that you have been introduced to programming (through JavaScript) we're going to make it official. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_curve">learning curve</a> for this (and most) new material requires repeated exposure, but more importantly, however, is the notion that there are many many ways to do something. It is a novice's mistake to assume that once you've been exposed to one way, that is <em>the only way</em> to do it.</p>
        <p>The videos this week offer some advice I might not recommend, but alternative perspective is important. I'll leave it up you to find and ask about different techniques or reasons to use one technoque over another. The first two chapters should be familiar, so getting through the material will keep you sharp. <strong>The chapter on Objects and Arrays is extremely important to watch and understand.</strong></p>

      <h2>Practice</h2>
      <p>Data is often nested and compartmentalized in order to give it more meaning. Just like your bedroom closet, when you start to break a structure into components parts and functions, things make a little more sense when it comes time to grab a pair of socks (information retrieval). This week, you're going to create a dataset mirrored on some real world thing, a closet or refrigerator; whatever you want. (Remember to revisit the bottom of this week's outline if you need to see an example).</p>
      <hr class="clear ruled t b" />
      <div class="half float left indented">
        <h4>On the Markup side of things</h4>
        <p>We know that <abbr>html</abbr> is a tree structure, it can and does represent data, but now I want you to actually use it as such. <strong>Note.</strong> if you haven't been doing the readings, I  expect this will be extremely challenging. For those that have kept up, you should be able to take a stab at this without too much hair-pulling.</p>
        <p>Bonus points if you can get a dataset to be visually interesting, but I'm going to look at the source code to see how well you can use markup to semantically represent data. Put this work in <code>practice/4/index.html</code>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="half float left">
        <h4>On the JavaScript side</h4>
        <p>Conversely, you will use JavaScript to describe the exact same dataset. The learning goal is to see the juxtaposition of describing information in two different formats, their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
        <p>The object you chose to outline in <abbr>html</abbr> can be replicated, outlined and declared as a JavaScript object. The notation is fairly flexible but you may have to go about building your object in a trial and error fashion. To accomplish it that way you should have your browser console open, and you should work iteratively in <code>practice-4.js</code>.</p>
      </div>
      <hr class="clear"/>
      <p class="note focus">I hear the looming question <q>I don't get it, what do you want to see?</q> Here is the answer: <q>What do you want to show me?</q> Read, watch, and research the material, and I have confidence that you'll be able to interpret the assignment successfully. I'll review your practice and give you feedback. Please please please remember: I named this component of the course <strong>practice</strong> for a reason. If it was an assignment with a specific outcome, I'd call it an <strong>assignment</strong>.</p>

      <h2>What to answer</h2>
      <p>From the source material provided, answer the following questions in readme. If you want to provide working examples in your html/css/JS, I certainly wouldn't be disappointed. Without further ado, I pulled these 4 questions out of this week's videos and readings.</p>
      <hr class="ruled"/>
      <ul>
        <li>What is a 'clearfix' used for? Show/describe an example of when it is needed.</li>
        <li>What happens when you don't declare the <code>var</code> keyword?</li>
        <li>What is an object reference and what odd behavior does it exhibit?</li>
        <li>What is the essential difference between an object and an array when it comes to storing values?</li>
      </ul>
