  <p class="intro">The last study can be interpreted a few ways, and I will leave that up to you.</p>
  <p>Under the topic of order, and for your last study, you are going to employ <abbr>html</abbr> <abbr>css</abbr> and now JavaScript to some cohesive end. In the checklist I have put together, I have added some items that require research, and consequently have prefaced those items with <q>correctly use</q>. This work can be experimental but attempt to interpret <strong>order</strong> in a way meaningful to you. Here is the criteria.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>You have gone through <a class="copy" href="/outline/assignments/SWM/practice/4.txt">your checklist</a></li>
    <li>The code does not have any red checkboxes in the developer console.</li>
    <li>The resulting page/app/outcome exhibits the quality of being ordered.</li>
  </ol>
  
  
  <script type="text/javascript">
    document.querySelector('a[href$=".txt"]').addEventListener('click', function(evt) {
      evt.preventDefault();
      var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
      xhr.open('GET', this.href);
      xhr.addEventListener('load', function(evt) {
        window.prompt("Copy to clipboard: Ctrl+C, Enter", evt.target.responseText);
      });
      xhr.send();
    })
  </script>
