    <h2>Redux</h2>
    <p class="intro">Refactoring is an important notion, and last week I offered some challenging JavaScript explorations. This week will be round two of those same ideas.</p>
    <p>Last week three projects were given: if you did all three, this is your opportunity to revise and improve them. However, my hunch is that you probably didn't get to all three, so hopefully we'v had a fruitful discussion today helping to iron out wrinkled concepts. For next week, you will have attempted all three projects tucked into your week 7 folder. If you've been neglecting any facet of our triad (<abbr>HTML</abbr>, <abbr>CSS</abbr>, JavaScript), spend some time making up for that on this week’s practice.</p>
    <p class="focus t">Start thinking about your final project—your practice work next will likely involve some attention to this.</p>
