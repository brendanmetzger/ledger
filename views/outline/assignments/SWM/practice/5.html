    <h2>An Easy Challenge</h2>
    <p class="intro">Who do you know in your life that does beautiful work? Think about it, it can be a family member, friend, or someone you look up to and have never met.</p>
    <p>Filmmaker Lars von Trier’s 2003 documentary <em>The Five Obstructions</em> is one of the most compelling testaments to creativity I have ever seen. Essentially, von Trier challenges his mentor, Jørgen Leth, into remaking his 1967 avant-garde film <em>The Perfect Human</em>, 5 more times with absurd obstructions; the first being Leth <q>must remake the film in Cuba, with no set, and with no shot lasting longer than twelve frames</q> (0.5 seconds).</p>
    <section class="tt whitepaper">
      <p>With this absurdity in mind, begin your practice this week thinking about someone you admire—just as a starting point to get yourself in a creative mood. The bulk of your effort this week will be researching functions, but I want to present a challenge where you actually <em>think</em> about functions. The goal here is to get your brain to flip-flop between analytical and creative mode, which is a skill in itself. Some of you may only have time to do the bare minimum while others may stretch their minds trying to come up with creative solutions. I want to give you opportunities to be creative, but don’t be frightened, just work through the obstacles. This is technically very easy, I’ll leave it up to each individual to make it as challenging as they prefer.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>You are going to design 5 functions</strong>
          <ul style="margin:1em 0;">
            <li>Your functions may be fictitious if JavaScript is still too nebulous.</li>
            <li>Try thinking about functions as machines.</li>
            <li>Machines that given input, manufacture some sort of output.</li>
            <li>Within the machine, what are the steps involved to make it operate.</li>
            <li>Consider if the machine should work in concert with other functions, how would they operate together?</li>
            <li>in your the practice 5 index.html, write about each function telling how you made it, why, etc. Be creative, and follow the rules below.</li>
            <li>If you think you have a good grasp on syntax, try sketching your functions in actual JavaScript.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Correctly use the 5 following <abbr>HTML</abbr> elements at least once: <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;time&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;mark&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;dfn&gt;</code></li>
        <li>Correctly use the 5 following <abbr>css</abbr> properties at least once: <code>bottom</code>, <code>box-shadow</code>, <code>background-size</code>, <code>border-radius</code> and <code>text-transform</code> </li>
        <li>Correctly use the 5 following <abbr>css</abbr> selectors at least once: <code>[data-*]</code>, <code>[attr^=value]</code>, <code>A ~ B</code>, <code>A > B</code> and <code>*</code></li>
        <li>Correctly use the 5 following <abbr>css</abbr> pseudos at least once: <code>:target</code>, <code>:nth-child()</code>, <code>:before</code>, <code>:only-child</code> and <code>:not</code></li>
        <li>Correctly use the 5 following units/measurements at least once: <code>vh</code>, <code>vmin</code>, <code>hsla()</code>, <code>rem</code> and <code>calc()</code></li>
      </ol>

      <p class="focus">I've noted a few Lynda.com videos as well as some reading material in the outline. Go through that material, and try to go further on your own. If you are unable to implement your functions in actual JavaScript, use your practice-5.js to take notes from your research. For the rest of the semester, you <strong>must have practice work</strong> visible in your .html, your .css, and your .js files respectively!</p>
