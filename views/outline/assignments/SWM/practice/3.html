  <h2>Assignment</h2>
  <p>So we have some content to work with in the future, and to get a little colorful, make a quick gallery. It will be beneficial to get a head start so you have something to work on as in-class practice, but I’ll leave that up to you. You could use portfolio
    work, use your instagram stuff, or just find a bunch of great cat gifs.</p>
  <p>I guarantee we will work on stuff you do here for a good portion of the semester. If you don't understand the concepts at play, do your research.</p>
