  <p class="intro">This study is straightforward—make a gallery. It will eventually serve as a tangible start to apply interactive JavaScript; get the layout kinks worked out ahead of time.</p>
  <p>You could use portfolio work or a personal collection of photos. If you don’t understand the concepts at play, do your research. I've made it even easier to track your agenda. <strong>Copy and paste <a class="copy" href="/outline/assignments/SWM/practice/3.txt">this todo list</a> into your readme.txt file to fill out</strong>    as you work on this assignment.</p>
  <p class="tt focus">Note, I have left the last two items of the TODO list blank—items I have left for you to fill in. There are ever-advancing topics (like media queries &amp; mobile first) so make a goal for yourself so that I can see your organization and research principles.</p>
