    <h2>Assignment</h2>
    <p>So we have some content to work with in the future, and to get a little colorful, make a quick gallery. It will be beneficial to get a head start so you have something to work on as in-class practice, but Iâ€™ll leave that up to you. You could use portfolio work, use your instagram stuff, or just find a bunch of great cat gifs.</p>
    <h3 class="tt">Gallery</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a gallery - at least nine (9) of your images.</li>
      <li>Name the images in an organized way and put in a directory.</li>
      <li>Gallery should have a lower resolution thumbnail and a higher resolution version. (again, pay attention to names/organization)</li>
    </ul>
