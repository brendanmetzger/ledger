# Strategy
I have nothing to review yet.


# TODO
- [ ] Collected 9 images: have a lower resolution thumbnail size and a higher resolution full size image
- [ ] Named the images in an organized way and put in a directory or separate directories for different sizes
- [ ] Created a gallery in HTML
- [ ] Floated the images in a 3 âœ• 3 grid
- [ ] Your global stylsheet has a `.container` class
- [ ] Your global stylesheet has a universal selector with a `box-sizing` set to `border-box`
- [ ] Clicking on any image will link to the high resolution version
- [ ] You know what `.container` class and `box-sizing` do
- [ ] Your code is organized either by your hand or with a plugin

# Questions and Outcome
None.
