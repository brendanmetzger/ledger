    <h2>You Have Options</h2>
    <p class="intro">The practice work this week will come from a 3<sup>rd</sup> party and be more dependent on your research and study work.</p>
    <p>Make sure you read Chapter 14 of <em>Eloquent Javascript</em> (linked in the outline). At the bottom, there will be a section called <strong>Exercises</strong>, where you will find three topics to work on. As far as how much to accomplish, I suggest you do as many as you can until you run into a wall. If you have trouble, outline your issues and we’ll go over them next class. The reading material also gives hints. The important thing about all of these projects is that they employ <code>addEventListener</code>.</p>
    <dl class="whitepaper t">
      <dt>Censored Keyboard</dt>
      <dd>This is a great assignment to learn about several important things: keyboard events, preventing default actions, and input elements</dd>
      <dt>Mouse Trail</dt>
      <dd>This is fun, and incorporates the event object,  arrays, and more mouse positioning. This project might open your eyes to the power of interactive programming.</dd>
      <dt>Tabs</dt>
      <dd>If interface design is your thing, this might be a good one to work through. Incorporates adding events to multiple items, and the data attribute.</dd>
      <dd><strong>Note:</strong> The assignments gives example <abbr>HTML</abbr>—you can do better than the example given.</dd>
