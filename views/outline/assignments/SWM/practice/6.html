    <h2>You Have Options</h2>
    <p class="intro">The practice work this week will come from a 3<sup>rd</sup> party.</p>
    <p>Make sure you read Chapter 14 of <em>Eloquent Javascript</em> (linked in the outline). At the bottom, there will be a section called <strong>Exercises</strong>, where you will find three topics to work on. As far as how much to accomplish, I suggest you do as many as you can until you run into a wall. If you have trouble, outline your issues and weâ€™ll go over them next class. The reading material also gives hints.</p>
