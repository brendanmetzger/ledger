  <h2>Understanding the Medium of Web Development</h2>
  <p>The internet, perhaps above all else, is the modern means of cummunication. We continually evolve our writing systems into various broadcast systems and the internet is the backbone for essentually all distributions of content: broadcast media, written news, and even water-cooler blather (I'm looking at you, twitter). Perhaps there is a discussion to be had on the disadvantages of this ubiquitious system, but for the time being, we'll focus on our role as players in this game.</p>
