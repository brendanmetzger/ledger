    <h2>Understanding the Medium of Web Development</h2>
    <p>The internet is the vehicle through which we communicate, yet few humans have any clue what it is. We have evolved our writing systems into various broadcast systems and the internet is now the backbone for essentually all distributions of content: broadcast media, written news, and even water-cooler blather (I'm looking at you, twitter). Perhaps there is a discussion to be had on the disadvantages of this ubiquitious system, but for the time being, we'll focus on our role as players in this game.</p>
    <p>Most of research studies this semester will allow generic content; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum">lorem ipsum</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_position_only"><abbr title="For Position Only">fpo</abbr> images</a>—that is, in order to save you some time and focus on learning techniques and being creative in other ways. However, when I assign topics that do involve content (such as this one), its difficult to find something everyone is interested in. As your instructor, I also struggle getting to know your strengths and weaknesses until they present themselves over the semester. To remedy both problems, the topic is be something I assume everyone is into (at least according to Freud): <strong>yourself</strong>. I expect you know a thing or two about your own experience, and I'll get to know you a little bit too.</p>

    <h3>Prep Work</h3>
    <p>The beginning weeks will be a chance to brush up (or learn) <abbr>HTML</abbr>. Markup languages are relatively easy to learn, and because of that, many students neglect reasearching them to their full advantage. Consult the <a href="[/$course/index/1/$section:@id]">outline</a> to get a better feel for <abbr>HTML</abbr> resources and tutorials.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Listen to the <em>Freakonomics Radio</em> episode <a href="http://freakonomics.com/podcast/internet/">Is the Internet Being Ruined?</a> It's a good thinkpiece.</li>
      <li>You have download the <a href="[/$template/template]">course template</a> (zipped)</li>
      <li>You have reviewed the course template and are familiar with all of the files.</li>
      <li>Familiarize youself with this list of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element"><abbr>HTML</abbr> Elements</a>, and figure out what the thumbs down, beaker and trash icons indicate.</li>
      <li>Update all global.js and global.css paths in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag on every index page.</li>
      <li>With an <abbr>ftp</abbr> client upload/sync your entire SWM directory into your pub directory on the IAM server, and make sure <a href="[$student:@url]">this link</a> works.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="tt">
    <h3>Independent Study</h3>
    <p>Research and find answers to the following topics on your own as we'll be discussing them in class at some point.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is the internet and how does it work?</li>
      <li>Know why markup languages exist, what they do, and why <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> exists.</li>
      <li>Know about file paths and <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locations">URLS</abbr></li>
      <li>Know your <a href="[/$course/index/0/$section:@id#workflow]">web development tools</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="tt">
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>Make a perfectly organized, thoughtful, <abbr>html</abbr> page and upload it to your server. If you design it, good on you—I encourage that, but this effort is about communication and markup, so don't let that be the concept that falls through the cracks.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start Now: you have two weeks. Depending on your major, you should be learning brainstorming and techniques to encourage creative behavior—journal and take notes, sketch and draw schematics, read a lot.</li>
      <li>Author several paragraphs of text. These are to serve as a guide. You can reference text</li>
      <li>Apply several items of media to accompany the text.</li>
      <li class="discuss">Make sure to add captions for all media.</li>
      <li>Be creative, see my list below for starting points.</li>
      <li>When in doubt, author a readme and we will discuss next week.</li>
      <li>Consider if your work can take the form of a portfolio, a gallery, an essay, a map, a schematic, or some combination (hopefully) thereof</li>
      <li>As you are familiarizing yourself with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element"><abbr>HTML</abbr> Elements</a>, try using some of them just to use them correctly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ideas &amp; Inspiration</h3>
    <p>So the basic premise of this study is to produce content—ideally a great deal of it. The production of all this content should push you to learn more <abbr>html</abbr> than any prescription I can give, and even better, I hope you come up with an idea that you can't quite get worked out and you bring those questions to class. Some majors, especially Interaction Design, are going to spend a fair bit of effort learning about <strong>user centered design</strong>. In a nutshell, this means that when you design an outcome, you have your users specifically in mind, and you think about what they are trying to accomplish. As I am the instructor of this course, in a way, you are my users, so I'd very much like to know who you are, what you want, and how I can make that happen. Serious business, for sure.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What drives you to work hard? How would you show that? How would you demonstrate your work ethic? Your talent?</li>
      <li>What is the last book you read? Or perhaps your favorite book?</li>
      <li>Who/what do you respect and why?</li>
      <li>If you could live in some other era, when would it be? Why?</li>
      <li>What, if anything scares/excites you about the future?</li>
      <li>When are/aren't you motivated?</li>
      <li>Where are you from and how do you feel about it?</li>
      <li>What is the best/worst part about Columbia?</li>
      <li>Is time management an issue? If yes (or no), how can one make better use of time?</li>
      <li>Is college necessary to acquiring skill? How would you make it better?</li>
    </ul>

  <p class="focus"><strong>Finished work is always completed in the corresponding location in the course template</strong> you have downloaded. When finished, you must upload it to the <abbr title="interactive arts &amp; media">IAM</abbr> server. There is a link on your dashboard next to each assignment titled 'preview'—use it to verify your work is in order—if you can see it after clicking that link, I can see it.</p>
