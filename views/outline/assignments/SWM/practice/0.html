    <h2>Understanding the Medium of Web Development</h2>
    <p>The internet—and approaching ubiquity—is the vehicle through which we communicate. We have evolved our writing systems into various broadcast systems and the internet is now the backbone for essentually all distributions of content: broadcast media, written news, and even water-cooler blather (I'm looking at you, twitter). Perhaps there is a discussion to be had on the disadvantages of this ubiquitious system, but for the time being, we'll focus on our role as players in this game.</p>
    <p>Most of research studies this semester will allow generic content; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum">lorem ipsum</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_position_only"><abbr title="For Position Only">fpo</abbr> images</a>—that is, in order to save you some time, I will not require you to provide actual content. However, when I assign topics that do involve content (such as this one), its difficult to find something everyone is interested in. As your instructor, I also struggle getting to know your strengths and weaknesses until they present themselves over the semester. To remedy both problems, the topic is be something I assume everyone is into (at least according to Freud): <strong>yourself</strong>. I expect you know a thing or two about your own experience, and I'll get to know you a little bit too.</p>

  <h3>Prep Work</h3>
  <p>The beginning weeks will be a chance to brush up (or learn) <abbr>HTML</abbr>. Markup languages are relatively easy to learn, and because of that, many students neglect reasearching them to their full advantage. Consult the <a href="[/$course/index/1/$section:@id]">outline</a> to get a better feel for <abbr>HTML</abbr> resources and tutorials.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Listen to the <em>Freakonomics Radio</em> episode <a href="http://freakonomics.com/podcast/internet/">Is the Internet Being Ruined?</a></li>
    <li>You have download the <a href="[/$template/template]">course template</a> (zipped)</li>
    <li>You have reviewed the course template and are familiar with all of the files.</li>
    <li>Familiarize youself with the list of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element"><abbr>HTML</abbr> Elements</a>, and figure out what the thumbs down, beaker and trash icons indicate.</li>
    <li>Update all global.js and global.css paths (show video) in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag on every index page.</li>
    <li>With an <abbr>ftp</abbr> client upload/sync your entire SWM directory into your pub directory on the IAM server, and make sure <a href="[$student:@url]">this link</a> works.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Independent Study</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>What is the internet</li>
    <li>Know why markup languages exist, what they do, and why <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> exists</li>
    <li>Know about file paths and <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locations">URLS</abbr></li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Outcome</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Start Now: you have two weeks. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Note-taking">Journal and take notes</a>, sketch and draw <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schematic">schematics</a>, read a lot.</li>
    <li>Author several paragraphs of text. These are to serve as a guide. You can reference text</li>
    <li>Apply several items of media to accompany the text.</li>
    <li class="discuss">Make sure to add captions for all media.</li>
  </ul>
