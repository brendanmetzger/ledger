    <h2>Naming and Navigation</h2>
    <p class="______ float left pad">This week we want to start getting serious about programming, so as I mentioned, we'll slow down our HTML/CSS quest a tad. That said, for your html/css practice, I want you to work on creating a navigation bar or some sort of navigation element. This element will live in <code>practice/2/index.html</code>. I've compiled the plain text of a list for you: <a href="[/$student:course/peers]" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;">a list of all of your coursemates</a>. Not only do I think it’s a good idea to see what everyone else in the class is up to, I think it’s a reminder that stuff you put on the web is to be consumed by others: you’re communicating something.</p>

  <h2>Introduction to Programming</h2>
  <p>Lynda.com has a great introduction to programming (general programming), but coincidentally beneficial to us, it uses JavaScript as the example language to illustrate the process and requirements. This points to the power of the language as both a useful learning tool, and as a great language to illustrate the important parts and the caveats of programming languages that some higher-level languages even avoid. <q>it’s highly relevant, and pretty friendly for beginners.</q></p>
  <p>Starting here, I want you to carefully watch <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/What-programming/83603/90430-4.html" class="watch">chapters 1–4</a> this week. It is about an hour and a half, but it is slow and careful and will make the rest of the semester worthwhile. (We will be going up to chapter 11). In the videos that follow, you will see the speaker use some files, namely a <code>container.html</code> file and a <code>script.js</code> and he uses default text editor. You will be using your <code>practice/2/index.html</code>, <code>practice/2/scripts/practice-2.js</code> and your own text editor. You've already corrected all of your file paths, so you can begin working with your JavaScript file right away.</p>
  <h3>Checklist:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In <code>practice/2/scripts/practice-2.js</code> you should be following along with the videos.</li>
    <li>Use comments to keep notes within your code and separate chapters and exercises.</li>
    <li>The author makes extensive use of the <code>alert</code> function. I highly suggest you swap out <code>console.log</code> and get familiar with what it is doing (plus, all those dialogs are annoying and don’t keep a visual record of output).</li>
    <li>If you have questions, add them to README.txt. If you have notes you want to keep track of throughout the semester, add them to the README.</li>
    <li>If you have nothing to write in your readme, <strong>delete the contents so I know you had nothing to say.</strong></li>
    <li>Every little bit of code should be organized, my nitpicking will get stricter throughout the semester.</li>
  </ul>
