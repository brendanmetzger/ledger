    <h2>Practice Assignment</h2>
    <p>This week the goal is to use articles, sections, etc. to create the outline of a document. I gleaned some stuff from wikipedia and put together a <a href="/student/structure/outline.html" class="download">plain text outline</a> that you can use as content for this exercise. <strong>Note:</strong> when gathering that content, you will need to view source to do the cutting and pasting.</p>
    <h3>Your Task</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Once you have the content, paste it into the html > body > main Element of your SWM/practice/1/index.html file</li>
      <li>Referencing the <em>Outlining an <abbr>HTML</abbr> document</em> above, start organizing the HTML</li>
      <li>Once marked up, apply text styles and color to give your markup some aesthetic properties</li>
      <li><strong>Upload your work to the IAM server</strong> so I can see it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Moving Forward...</h3>
    <p>Now that your course site has (hopefully) been set up, you can manipulate the HTML and CSS as you like. Before you do, there are some things I want you to be hyper-critical of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not delete any practice/project files; the basic template structure (<abbr>html</abbr>, <abbr>css</abbr>, js) must remain intact so I can find your assignments without you having to go out of your way to submit anything.</li>
      <li>If you <b>add files</b>, add links and additions to sitemap.xml so I can find them.</li>
      <li>Keep your HTML, JS, and CSS as organized as possible. Run your html through a validator if you think it might be broken. Always close your empty tags (<code>img</code>, <code>link</code>, <code>br</code>, etc.), and make sure assets always have the correct path.</li>
      <li>Maintain a global stylesheet and global css file that you use in every project (it should already be linked). The goal is to work on programs incrementally, so hopefully extra effort in some weeks will continue to benefit you in the long term.</li>
    </ul>
