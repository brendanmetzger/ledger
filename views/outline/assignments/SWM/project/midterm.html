    <h2 class="strong ruled bottom">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="intro">Projects are an opportunity to apply the knowledged gained through practice, research and participation in the class thus far. The opportunity to learn from one another is supremely valuableâ€”I've learned a great deal from my colleagues, peers and of course, students.</p>
    <p>Your midterm project is of your choosing. The emphasis is to show that you are learning to research and apply technical skills. Projects should have a concept, and that concept can and should be enforced by aesthetic and technical execution.</p>

    <h2>Criterion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Code must be perfectly organized</li>
      <li>Vast majority (ideally all) of code is authored by you. In the event you turn to a search engine for assistance, document and attribute that <strong>very thoroughly</strong>.</li>
      <li>Stylesheets should be more than 150 lines.</li>
      <li>Sloppy and or extraneous styles will be marked as such.</li>
      <li>Concepts from outlines must be shown and applied.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Critique / Outcome</h2>
    <p>You will briefly present your work to myself and the class on the projector. With presentations it is always nice to put you audience at ease by having something thoughtful about your own work. </p>
