    <h2>Your goal: <strong>Iterate</strong></h2>
    <p>I don't care if the ideas are good or bad, if the design is elegant or otherwise. I am uninterested in theory and concept at the moment. This is about habit development and you are going to be asked to communicate one message above all else: you research, test and apply techniques. It can be odd, beautiful, or neither. There is no aesthetic concern here. The point is you can work forwards given previous work. Do not show blank or nonsense revisions: show research and idea development. That's that.</p>
    <p>I have given the fewest expectations, and I want to see your process. Ultimately, in the coming weeks you will need the skills to layout images in a grid to make a gallery, the file management skills to link to higher resolution versions and the layout skills to implement a lightbox. Show, through your work, you have a process for attaining those skills.</p>
    <p>When you sit down to do something, your work must show you researched something and applied an idea from that research. It should look like you spent about an hour. If you don't have an hour to give, don't pretend you do. <strong>Do not write <q>asdf</q> or a blank space at the end of a file for points</strong>; too many people have poked the bear, it is now officially <strong>cheating</strong>. </p>
