    <h2 class="strong ruled bottom">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="intro">Projects are an opportunity to apply the knowledge gained through practice, research and participation in the class thus far. The opportunity to learn from one another is supremely valuable; I've learned a great deal from my colleagues, peers and of course, students. Now is an opportunity to show the area you are interested in and apply your craft.</p>
    <p>Your midterm project is of your choosing. The emphasis is to show that you are <strong>learning to research and apply technical skills</strong> needed to be successful in this course. <mark>Projects should have a concept, and that concept can and should be enforced by aesthetic and technical execution</mark>.</p>

    <h2>Criterion</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Code must be perfectly organized</li>
      <li>Vast majority (ideally all) of code is authored by you. In the event you turn to a search engine and glean ideas from other projects or tutorials, document and attribute that <strong>very thoroughly</strong>.</li>
      <li>Sloppy, duplicate and or extraneous work will be penalized.</li>
      <li>Concepts from outlines and the course material thus far should be applied.</li>
      <li>Site need not be more than one page (but obviously can be)</li>
      <li>Be ambitious, work hard.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Critique / Outcome</h2>
    <p>You will briefly present your work to myself and the class on the projector. With presentations it is always nice to put you audience at ease by having something thoughtful about your own work.</p>
    <p class="focus tt">The week before the midterm is due I will meet briefly with everyone to discuss your project ideas and check in on progress.</p>
