    <h2>A study on measurement</h2>
    <p>By now, I hope you have familiarity with <abbr title="hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr> and outlining (articles, sections, etc) and are fundamentally able to structure and generate content as you need. Now we will go into actual studies where your primary concern is to show me you understand a topic.</p>
    <p>This week’s topic is <strong>measurement</strong>, and through in class examples and references provided in the outline, you should have an idea of length/size determining units and the <abbr title="cascading stylesheet">CSS</abbr> properties that are affected by them, or, at the very least, be aware about how to learn these properties.</p>
    <h3 class="tt">Your Goal</h3>
    <p><strong>Do</strong> unequivocally demonstrate that you are aware of of the <abbr title="cascading stylesheet">CSS</abbr> units by making examples of their usage—specifically em, rem, px, %, vw, vh, vmin and vmax. Explore how the <abbr title="Cascading stylesheet">css</abbr> properties height/width, margin, padding and border. Utilize all of the typographic properties that have been demonstrated previously. <strong>Do not</strong> worry about design or strategy or semantic <abbr title="hypertext markup language">html</abbr> usage. Spend at minimum five (5) hours on this over the next 2 weeks. <strong class="discuss">Admire your effort.</strong></p>
    <h3 class="tt">Outcome</h3>
    <p>You will be able to use and deploy units confidently while having a reasonable expectation on how they operate and which unit to use for any particular task. You will be comfortable with the methods you have available within <abbr title="cascading stylesheets">CSS</abbr> to measure and plan <em>anything</em>. If at no point in the study you found yourself researching documentation and learning something outside of the notes provide here, you are not putting in the correct amount of time/effort.</p>
    <h3 class="tt">Example</h3>
    <p>Below I have manipulated the styles of two paragraphs with several units. Because I only spent about five minutes creating these examples I have only demonstrated a tiny understanding of the usage of properties and units; you will do a much better job of showing you know why and how to use them in multidinous ways. <strong>I expect such learning will happen through experimentation.</strong></p>
    <div style="margin:2em 0;padding:2em;background-color:#fff;border:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1)">
      <p style="background-color:#444;color:#f8f8f8;font-size:2em;width:20%;padding:5vw;line-height:1;">This paragraph has a <code>width</code> of <code>20%</code>, has a <code>font-size</code> of <code>2em</code>, has a <code>padding</code> of <code>5vw</code> and has a <code>line-height</code> of <code>1</code>. It has no height or margin specifed.</p>
      <p style="background-color:#444;color:#f8f8f8;height:15vmin;letter-spacing:3px;margin:10rem;">This paragraph has a <code>height</code> of <code>36vmin</code> and has a <code>letter-spacing</code> of <code>3px</code> and <code>margin</code> of <code>2rem 0</code>. It has no padding or width specified.</p>
