    <h2>Farewell</h2>
    <p>I will leave this site up for awhile should you need to revisit anything—but it is running on a freebie server, and who knows how long that will last. Should you need to contact me, I will occasionally check my colum email, but I can also be reached at <a href="mailto:brendan.metzger@gmail.com">brendan.metzger@gmail.com</a>—reach out with any questions, suggestions, or viral memes.</p>
