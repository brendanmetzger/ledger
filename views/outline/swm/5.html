    <h1 class="massive">Objects &amp; Models</h1>
    <p class="intro">Coming up an introduction to the <em>Document Object Model</em> as seen by <abbr>html</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">css</abbr> and JavaScript. Media Queries, and key components and principles of responsive design will be introduced. In class we will go over a new example  starting with a media query, then utilizing <code>float</code> to attain a layout, explore <code>vmax</code> and <code>vmin</code> more carefully, introduce the <code>overflow</code> property.</p>

    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>Last week you spent time learning about the box model and some of the quirks involved. JavaScript types, including arrays and objects were introduced. Look at the warm up exercises below, and given some time, I will demonstrate some solutions at the end of class.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Warm up: <a href="http://codepen.io/brendanmetzger/pen/RGyNva?editors=1100#0">refactor this <abbr>html</abbr></a> to be less redundant.</li>
      <li>Warm up: <a href="http://codepen.io/brendanmetzger/pen/zKjGBg/?editors=1100#0">refactor this to remove <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> tag</a></li>

    <h3>Reference &amp; Practice Material</h3>
    <p class="intro">Here is the list of <a href="http://iam.colum.edu/brendan.metzger/vids/">previous lectures</a> that are available to watch. Midterms are starting and though you’ll have two weeks to complete you need to continue spending time reviewing previous outlines and introducing new material into your repertoire. Post midterm, we will begin actually using JavaScript, so you should have watched and practiced enough to let the nervousness subside and be comfortable dealing with the basics: <code>variables</code>, <code>objects</code>, <code>arrays</code>, <code>conditions</code>, <code>operators</code>, <code>loops</code> and <code>functions</code>.</p>

      <dt>JavaScript</dt>
      <dd>I like to read—I think it is also helpful to use syntax to learn syntax. Read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html">Values, Types, and Operators</a> and <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html">program structure</a> from <em>Eloquent JavasScript</em> (book available if you like tangible things). <strong>For sure read this stuff.</strong></dd>
      <dd>Here is another <a href="https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Syntax-Learning-read-write/123563/133770-4.html">Lynda Series</a> that talks more specifically about JavaScript and covers the fundamentals.</dd>
      <dt>The Document Object Model (<abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>)</dt>
      <dd>It will be beneficial to watch the entirety of <a class="watch" href="http://www.lynda.com/HTML-tutorials/What-Document-Object-Model-DOM-Video/122462/137616-4.html">chapter one</a> of this series. It glosses over the Document Object model a bit, but it goes much further talking about using the browser’s console to inspect structure, <strong>which I think many of you may be interested in</strong>.</dd>
      <dd>Read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/13_dom.html">The Document Object Model</a> from <i>Eloquent Javascript</i>—gloss over any parts containing functions—we will cover them in the weeks to come. <strong>Read this too!</strong></dd>
      <dt><abbr>CSS</abbr></dt>
      <dd>At this point, we have covered all of our <abbr>CSS</abbr> selectors. That means, less and less class time will be spent going over, introducing, and answering those questions. If you’re still foggy about your selector options, you may find this <a class="watch" href="http://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Selectors/192036-2.html">Lynda series</a> valuable.</dd>
      <dd>If you have time you can read a bit of theory about <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design">responsive design</a> from <i>A List Apart</i>.</dd>
