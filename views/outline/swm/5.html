    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>Last week you spent time learning about the box model and some of the quirks involved. JavaScript types, including arrays and objects were introduced. Look at the warm up exercises below, and given some time, I will demonstrate some solutions at the end of class.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Warm up: <a href="http://codepen.io/brendanmetzger/pen/RGyNva?editors=1100#0">refactor this <abbr>html</abbr></a> to be less redundant.</li>
      <li>Warm up: <a href="http://codepen.io/brendanmetzger/pen/zKjGBg/?editors=1100#0">refactor this to remove <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> tag</a></li>

      <h2>Pseudo Classes</h2>
      <p>A class is added to an element to apply a style. In theory, a developer could create a perfect stylesheet with well defined classes, and then apply those classes to <abbr>HTML</abbr> later on, as necessary. With practice, you often write a stylesheet to set a baseline for yourself that fits a pattern of your development techniques, such as reseting the font size and margin of certain elements before you write any markup whatsoever. It is wise to consider what sort of classes you should always have on hand (like <code>.container</code> I mentioned in our intro to floats) that facilitate certain patterns you are sure to encounter on every project. On that note, let us consider some patterns.</p>
      <p><a href="http://codepen.io/brendanmetzger/pen/GjdJdy?editors=1100#0">For example</a>, say we are developing a typographic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide">style guide</a>, and we would like the first paragraph of every article to be 150% larger than the following paragraphs. Even though our style guide is only conceptual at this point, we know that we should be thinking about how to deal with first paragraphs. We could make a class for that—say <code>.enlarge</code> that we apply to a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and that would work well for most purposes.</p>
      <p>While that is a decent solution, and the generic nature of <code>.enlarge</code> is admirable, we didn't really address our problem as well as we could, and we are reliant on actually writing <abbr>html</abbr> to apply that class. At this point, we may notice the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_quantification">existential state</a> that <em>if there is at least one paragraph</em> in an article, then <em>some</em> paragraph must be the first. Does this present us with an opportunity? The answer is yes, indeed there is an opportunity, and we can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes">pseudo classes</a>.</p>
      <p>The adjacent list notes many of the pseudo classes available. Some like <code>:hover</code> are hopefully quite familiar. Some like <code>:focus</code> and <code>:enabled</code> are only for form elements, which is more advanced fodder. My advice is to become friendly with the ordering pseudos, which are those containing <strong>first</strong>, <strong>last</strong> and <strong>nth</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
    <p class="intro">Responsive web design is a technique used to modify layout, typography and other design considerations in response to the size and type of device used by the viewer. It can be elusive and frustrating, so some philosophy is necessary.</p>
    <section class="margins">
      <h3 class="tt">Mobile First</h3>
      <p><img src="/css/media/smartphone.svg" alt="Smartphone Graphic" class="float left" style="height:4em;margin-right:0.75em;"/><em>Mobile-first</em> design is an important concept I suggest you practice. Essentially, it means that you design something for the smallest screen you are supporting, and then you <strong>scale up</strong> to accommodate bigger screens and the more space you have available. The fact of the matter is that your mobile-first design is always very simple: it is only one column, type is generally designed to be read about 2 feet from a user’s face and interactive elements need to accommodate a fingertip.</p>
      <p>While this seems like an obviously good choice, in practice, few designers (or clients) are patient enough for this process, for a couple of reasons. Often the mobile design is done after the desktop because then a client can approve and adjust the look and feel. In addition, most designers don't work in an interactive design medium (like a text-editor/browser) so they are not very aware of how responsive design even works.</p>
      <p>From experience, these caveats delay a project significantly and it's painful and awkward to go from full-scale design to small, but relatively easy to go small to big. In other words, put on your skinny jeans before your holiday meal, not after. So if you want to get the knack of mobile development, <strong>always start mobile first</strong>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3 class="tt">Media Queries</h3>
      <p>Media Queries are pretty simple—if you have the gist of <abbr>CSS</abbr>, the won’t give you any trouble. Essentially, imagine you can divide your styles up by certain criteria: <q>if the screen is too small, load this stylesheet</q>, and likewise, you can target device types, landscape vs. portrait, etc. Say you asked yourself, <q>I want some really big text, but only on a really big screen.</q>. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">Media Queries</a> are where you begin, and once you get your site schematics figured out and media in place they can offer immediate solutions to problems with text size and layout problems. The <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp">W3Schools</a> reference is also a good starting point.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="tt whitepaper margins">
      <h4>Notes:</h4>
      <p>There is one more technical item you should be aware of. Be sure to investigate mobile-appropriate <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag">meta tags</a> to make sure your <abbr>css</abbr> is applied correctly. Remember, <code>meta</code> tags are used as instructions—they are invisible to users, but machines use that information to make other decisions.</p>
      <p><strong>Responsive design is a lot of philosophy and a little bit of technique</strong>. You've seen me employ all of the techniques you will ever need at this point: relative and viewport units, and now, media queries. From here, it becomes mostly strategy and having a good plan when you design, which we will work together on, but realistically takes years to appreciate.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="container tt ruled top">
      <h3 class="tt">Media Query Examples</h3>
      <p>As developer/designers I want to take every opportunity to point out to you that <strong>interactive design is based on context</strong>. Learn to design by approaching problems with <q>if... then...</q> in mind.</p>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/examples/queries.css" media="screen" charset="utf-8" />
      <div class="float left ______">
        <p class="note">Try adjusting your screen size and ratio. The media query is set up to monitor aspect-ratio—specifically if your screen is at least two times wider than it is tall. Such a scenario will cause the background color of the box to turn green. Likewise, any screen less than 1200px wide will adjust styles as well.</p>
        <p class="pad centered"><code>&lt;p class="responsive"&gt;Change....&lt;p&gt;</code></p>
        <p class="responsive code" style="color:#fff;width:75%;margin:3em auto 0;">Sensitive to window size<br/>and aspect ratio.</p>

    <h2>References and Practice Material</h2>
    <p class="intro">Midterms are starting and though you’ll have two weeks to complete you need to continue spending time reviewing previous outlines and introducing new material into your repertoire. Post midterm, we will begin actually using JavaScript, so you should have watched and practiced enough to let the nervousness subside and be comfortable dealing with the basics: <code>variables</code>, <code>objects</code>, <code>arrays</code>, <code>conditions</code>, <code>operators</code>, <code>loops</code> and <code>functions</code>.</p>

      <dt>JavaScript</dt>
      <dd>I like to read—I think it is also helpful to use syntax to learn syntax. Read<a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html">Values, Types, and Operators</a> and <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html">program structure</a> from <em>Eloquent JavasScript</em> (book available if you like tangible things). <strong>For sure read this stuff.</strong></dd>
      <dd>Here is another <a href="https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Syntax-Learning-read-write/123563/133770-4.html">Lynda Series</a> that talks more specifically about JavaScript and covers the fundamentals.</dd>
      <dt>The Document Object Model (<abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>)</dt>
      <dd>It will be beneficial to watch the entirety of <a class="watch" href="http://www.lynda.com/HTML-tutorials/What-Document-Object-Model-DOM-Video/122462/137616-4.html">chapter one</a> of this series. It glosses over the Document Object model a bit, but it goes much further talking about using the browser’s console to inspect structure, <strong>which I think many of you may be interested in</strong>.</dd>
      <dd>Read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/13_dom.html">The Document Object Model</a> from <i>Eloquent Javascript</i>—gloss over any parts containing functions—we will cover them in the weeks to come. <strong>Read this too!</strong></dd>

      <dd>At this point, we have covered all of our <abbr>CSS</abbr> selectors. That means, less and less class time will be spent going over, introducing, and answering those questions.
