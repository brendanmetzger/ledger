    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>Last week you spent time learning about the box model and some of the quirks involved. More importantly, you spent some time learning about objects, which we will investigate further today.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is a 'clearfix' used for? Show/describe an example of when it is needed.</li>
        <li>What happens when you don’t declare the <code>var</code> keyword?</li>
        <li>What is an object reference and what odd behavior does it exhibit?</li>
        <li>What is the essential difference between an object and an array when it comes to storing values?</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Pseudo Classes</h2>
    <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes">Pseudo Classes</a></p>
    <ul>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:link" title="The :link CSS pseudo-class lets you select links inside elements. This will select any link which has not yet been visited, even those already styled using selector with other link-related pseudo-classes like :hover, :active or :visited. In order to appropriately style links, you need to put the :link rule before the other ones, as defined by the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active. The :focus pseudo-class is usually placed right before or right after :hover, depending on the expected effect."><code>:link</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:visited" title="The :visited CSS pseudo-class lets you select only links that have been visited. This style may be overridden by any other link-related pseudo-classes, that is :link, :hover, and :active, appearing in subsequent rules. In order to style appropriately links, you need to put the :visited rule after the :link rule but before the other ones, defined in the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active."><code>:visited</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:active" title="The :active CSS pseudo-class matches when an element is being activated by the user. It allows the page to give a feedback that the activation has been detected by the browser. When interacting with a mouse, this is typically the time between the user presses the mouse button and releases it. The :active pseudo-class is also typically matched when using the keyboard tab key. It is frequently used on &lt;a&gt; and &lt;button&gt; HTML elements, but may not be limited to just those."><code>:active</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover" title="The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user designates an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. This style may be overridden by any other link-related pseudo-classes, that is :link, :visited, and :active, appearing in subsequent rules. In order to style appropriately links, you need to put the :hover rule after the :link and :visited rules but before the :active one, as defined by the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active."><code>:hover</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus" title="The :focus CSS pseudo-class is applied when an element has received focus, either from the user selecting it with the use of a keyboard or by activating with the mouse (e.g. a form input)."><code>:focus</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:first-child" title="The :first-child CSS pseudo-class represents any element that is the first child element of its parent."><code>:first-child</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:last-child" title="The :last-child CSS pseudo-class represents any element that is the last child element of its parent."><code>:last-child</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child" title="The :nth-child(an+b) CSS pseudo-class matches an element that has an+b-1 siblings before it in the document tree, for a given positive or zero value for n, and has a parent element. More simply stated, the selector matches a number of child elements whose numeric position in the series of children matches the pattern an+b."><code>:nth-child</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-last-child" title="The :nth-last-child(an+b) CSS pseudo-class matches an element that has an+b-1 siblings after it in the document tree, for a given positive or zero value for n, and has a parent element."><code>:nth-last-child</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-of-type" title="The :nth-of-type(an+b) CSS pseudo-class matches an element that has an+b-1 siblings with the same element name before it in the document tree, for a given positive or zero value for n, and has a parent element. See :nth-child for a more thorough description of the syntax of its argument. This is a more flexible and useful pseudo selector if you want to ensure you're selecting the same type of tag no matter where it is inside the parent element, or what other different tags appear before it."><code>:nth-of-type</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:first-of-type" title="The :first-of-type CSS pseudo-class represents the first sibling of its type in the list of children of its parent element."><code>:first-of-type</code></a></li>

    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:empty" title="The :empty pseudo-class represents any element that has no children at all. Only element nodes and text (including whitespace) are considered. Comments or processing instructions do not affect whether an element is considered empty or not."><code>:empty</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target" title="The :target pseudo-class represents the unique element, if any, with an id matching the fragment identifier of the URI of the document."><code>:target</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:checked" title="The :checked CSS pseudo-class selector represents any radio (&lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot;&gt;), checkbox (&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot;&gt;) or option (&lt;option&gt; in a &lt;select&gt;) element that is checked or toggled to an on state. The user can change this state by clicking on the element, or selecting a different value, in which case the :checked pseudo-class no longer applies to this element, but will to the relevant one."><code>:checked</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:enabled" title="The :enabled CSS pseudo-class represents any enabled element. An element is enabled if it can be activated (e.g. selected, clicked on or accept text input) or accept focus. The element also has an disabled state, in which it can't be activated or accept focus."><code>:enabled</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:disabled" title="The :disabled CSS pseudo-class represents any disabled element. An element is disabled if it can't be activated (e.g. selected, clicked on or accept text input) or accept focus.

    <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
    <h3>Media Queries</h3>
    <p>Media Queries are pretty simple—if you have the gist of <abbr>CSS</abbr>, the won’t give you any trouble. Essentially, imagine you can divide your styles up by certain criteria; max/min screen sizes, device types, landscape vs. portrait, etc. Say you asked yourself, <q>I want some really big text, but only on a really big screen.</q>. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">Media Queries</a> are where you begin, and once you get your site schematics figured out and media in place they can offer immediate solutions to problems with text size and layout problems. The <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp">W3Schools</a> reference is also a good starting point.</p>
    <h3>New Units</h3>
    <p>When considering units, now would be a great time to start finding ways to implement <code>vh</code> and <code>vw</code>, which is your screen’s height and width broken down into 1% increments; ie. <code>10vh</code> is 10% of the viewport height. Here is an intro to <a href="https://css-tricks.com/viewport-sized-typography/">viewport sized typography</a></p>
    <h3>Mobile First</h3>
    <p><em>Mobile-first</em> design is a concept that pairs well with media-queries and is quite important for designers and developers to understand and apply. Mobile-first basically means that you design something for the smallest screen, and then you scale <strong>up</strong> to accommodate bigger screens and the more space you have available. This can be difficult to do in practice, but in general, it helps to structure your media queries this way—essentially, use <em>min-width</em> in favor of <em>max-width</em>.</p>
    <p class="focus t b h3">Be sure to investigate mobile-appropriate <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag">meta tags</a> to make sure your <abbr>css</abbr> is applied correctly.</p>

      <div class="float left ______">
        <p class="note">Try adjusting your screen size and ratio. The media query is set up to acknowledge a thin aspect-ratio—screen two times wider than it is tall—which will cause the background color to turn green. Any screen less than 1200px wide will adjust styles as well.</p>
        <p class="pad centered"><code>&lt;p class="responsive"&gt;Change....&lt;p&gt;</code></p>

    <h2>The Document Object Model</h2>
    <p class="intro">In the beginning all the technologies we are using probably seem very independent from one another as you gain experience you will see that they blur together in consistent ways. Let’s start with the things we know a little bit about.</p>
      <p>The nature of the structural relationship of <abbr>HTML</abbr> is going to play a key role in how I talk about the Document Object Model. Parents and children, siblings, ancestors and descendants describe relationships, they inform the ruleset that describes how the interact, they are consequential! Note, I have been using those terms since the very start of the semester.</p>
    <hr class="ruled"/>
    <section>
      <h3>Document (Markup Languages)</h3>
      <p>Markup languages take text and media and convert them into structured data. We are becoming familiar with <abbr>html</abbr>, but <abbr>html</abbr> is really just the simple-minded cousin of the affluent and worldly <abbr>xml</abbr>, or eXtensible markup language. Boiled down very simply, <abbr>html</abbr> is nothing more than a subset of <abbr>xml</abbr>—that funny looking bit at the top called <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> defines which tags we can use and how to use them. You could write your own doctype and use any tags you want; people do this with <abbr>xml</abbr> allowing this very simple set of formatting rules. These formatting rules allow us to write plain-text documents that are the starting point for converting <strong>data into objects</strong>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Object</h3>
      <p>The term <strong>object</strong> is a special word in the field of mathematics and computer science, representing various structures that can be described as having some distinct quality. When referring to the <q>the document object model</q> we are talking about the magic that happens after our plain old text—that has been carefully marked-up with <code>/</code> and <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> symbols—has been parsed by an algorithm to <em>mean something</em>, as a bunch of objects that are distinct, meaningful things. <mark>What once was a simple <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> in text has been turned into an object that we can now communicate with.</mark> <q>Hey, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, I’m going to set your text color to blue. Tell me about your family... who’s your parent... any siblings? I’m going to move you somewhere else, oh and when someone clicks on you, let me know, ok?</q>. An object, just like a toaster, has <em>properties</em> that describe what it is and how it works, and it has <em>methods</em> that allow it to perform certain tasks. <strong>Objects have properties and methods</strong> that we can communicate with, and this communication is known as programming.</p>

        <h3>Model (Tree Structures)</h3>
        <p>All together, The Document Object Model, or <abbr>dom</abbr>, is a <strong>standardized</strong>, cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in <abbr>html</abbr>, <abbr>xhtml</abbr> and <abbr>xml</abbr> documents. The objects, or <strong>nodes</strong> of every document are organized in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">tree structure</a>. Objects in the <abbr>dom</abbr> tree may be styled manipulated with other languages (wink/nod <abbr>CSS</abbr>, JavaScript).</p>
        <p>You can visualize tree structures because they are represented by a branch of mathematics known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory">graph theory</a>, which combines the rigor of math with the real-world pleasure of figuring things with your eyeballs. Taking a look at the diagram, given any node as a starting point, <em>you can get to any other node.</em> via a simple set of operations:  <code>firstChild</code>, <code>lastChild</code>, <code>nextSibling</code>, <code>previousSibling</code> and <code>parentNode</code>.</p>
        <p>Starting from <span class="code">html</span> (our document element), I can get to <span class="code">h2</span> by saying <q>documentElement - lastChild - lastChild - firstChild</q>. From my <span class="code">h2</span> I can get to my <span class="code">h1</span> by saying <q>parentNode - previousSibling - firstChild</q>. The things and methods we can use to parse these documents are very robust and can be confusing at times, but to a large extent, <strong>this concept governs the entire <abbr>api</abbr></strong>!</p>

        <h3>Presentation Environment</h3>
        <p>Tree structures are efficiently and easily <em>queried</em>. Careful arrangement of nodes, careful use of attributes, and careful use of semantic elements impart a great deal of information about our content. Developers convert this structure into a meaningful presentation using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_sheet_language">stylesheet language</a>—the one we are becoming familiar with is <abbr title="cascading stylesheets">css</abbr>. The document structure can (and should) be the only spot where we store meaning. The presentation view of our application or website can (and should) be the only place where we manipulate the structure into a pleasing design.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="half float left pad">
        <h3>Programming Environment</h3>
        <p>Programming languages, quite literally, know how to read, write, and manipulate <strong>everything</strong> regarding structured data. Many programming languages can work with the Document Object Model <abbr>api</abbr>, and the one concern ourselves with is, of course, JavaScript. The following list is copied verbatim from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">the Document Object Model</a> Wikipedia Page</p>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript can add, change, and remove all the HTML elements and attributes in the page</li>
          <li>JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page</li>
          <li>JavaScript can react to all existing events in the page</li>
          <li>JavaScript can create new events in the page</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p class="focus clear"><strong>Ponder</strong>: by this point you may be wondering, <q>why would I need anything besides <abbr>css</abbr>?</q>. The first thing you may notice is that you can’t add/remove content very robustly nor track events beyond 'hover'. More applicable to the <abbr>dom</abbr>, however, is an inability to work your way backwards up the tree (parentNode, previousSibling). Why might this be? Hint, think about what something like <em>node - previousSibling - nextSibling</em> is saying.</p>

    <h2>References and Practice Material</h2>
    <p class="intro">Midterms are starting and though you’ll have two weeks to complete you need to continue spending time reviewing previous outlines and introducing new material into your repertoire. Post midterm, we will begin actually using JavaScript, so you should have watched and practiced enough to let the nervousness subside and be comfortable dealing with the basics: <code>variables</code>, <code>objects</code>, <code>arrays</code>, <code>conditions</code>, <code>operators</code>, <code>loops</code> and <code>functions</code>.</p>
