    <p class="intro">Coming up an introduction to the <em>Document Object Model</em> as seen by <abbr>html</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">css</abbr> and JavaScript. Media Queries, and key components and principles of responsive design will be introduced. In class we will go over a new example  starting with a media query, then utilizing <code>float</code> to attain a layout, explore <code>vmax</code> and <code>vmin</code> more carefully, introduce the <code>overflow</code> property.</p>

    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>Last week you spent time learning about the box model and some of the quirks involved. JavaScript types, including arrays and objects were introduced. Look at the warm up exercises below, and given some time, I will demonstrate some solutions at the end of class.</p>
    <p>With 1/3 of the semester over, you have a solid start on one project and ideas taking shape on several others. Use the new techniques introduced every week to address shortcomings of the code delivered thus far.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Warm up: <a href="http://codepen.io/brendanmetzger/pen/zKjGBg/?editors=1100#0">refactor this to remove <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> tag</a></li>
      <li>Warm up: <a href="http://jsbin.com/sigopofunu/edit?html,css,output">refactor this <abbr>html</abbr></a> to be less redundant.</li>
      <li>Once you have read over <a href="#pseudo-classes">pseudo classes below</a> you can have a leg up on finishing <a href="http://jsbin.com/cekivoq/edit?css,output">this flipboard-logo design exercise</a>.</li>

    <p>I prefer to read about programmingâ€”using syntax to learn syntax, you can bookmark, reread passages as you need. Read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html">Values, Types, and Operators</a> from <cite>Eloquent JavasScript</cite> (book available if you like tangible things). </p>
