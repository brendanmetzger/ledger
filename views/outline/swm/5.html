    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>Last week you spent time learning about the box model and some of the quirks involved. More importantly, you spent some time learning about objects, which we will investigate further today.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What is a 'clearfix' used for? Show/describe an example of when it is needed.</li>
        <li>What happens when you don't declare the <code>var</code> keyword?</li>
        <li>What is an object reference and what odd behavior does it exhibit?</li>
        <li>What is the essential difference between an object and an array when it comes to storing values?</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Mobile First</h2>
    <p><em>Mobile first</em> design is a concept that is quite important for designers and developers to both understand and apply.</p>
      <p>Media Queries are pretty simple, useful..</p>

    <h2>The <strong>Document Object Model</strong></h2>
    <p class="intro">In the beginning all the technologies we are using probably seem very independent from one another as you gain experience you will see that they blur together in consistent ways. Let's start with the things we know a little bit about.</p>

    <section class="container">
      <div class="float left half indented margins">
        <h3>Tree Structures</h3>
        <p>The Document Object Model, or <abbr>dom</abbr>, is a <strong>standardized</strong>, cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in <abbr>html</abbr>, <abbr>xhtml</abbr> and <abbr>xml</abbr> documents. The objects, or <strong>nodes</strong> of every document are organized in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)">tree structure</a>. Objects in the <abbr>dom</abbr> tree may be addressed and manipulated with programming languages (wink/nod JavaScript). The public interface of a <abbr>dom</abbr> is specified in its application programming interface (<abbr>API</abbr>).</p>
        <p>Tree Structures are efficient, but more importantly, they have a feature you can begin to start visualizing. Consider the diagram on the right.</p>

      </div>
      <figure class="float left half">
        <!-- insert views/css/media/tree.svg -->
        <figcaption class="centered">A <em>Tree Structure</em>. Hover over a node (circle) to visualize the hierarchy.</figcaption>

      <h3>Markup Languages</h3>
      <p>Markup languages take text and media and convert them into structured data. We are becoming familiar with <abbr>html</abbr>, but <abbr>html</abbr> is really just the simple-minded cousin of the affluent and worldly <abbr>xml</abbr>, or eXtensible markup language.</p>
    </section>

    <h3>Programming Environment (JavaScript)</h3>
    <p>The followil list is copied verbatim from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model">the Document Object Model</a> Wikipedia Page</p>
    <ul>
      <li>JavaScript can add, change, and remove all the HTML elements and attributes in the page</li>
      <li>JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page</li>
      <li>JavaScript can react to all existing events in the page</li>
      <li>JavaScript can create new events in the page</li>
    </ul>
