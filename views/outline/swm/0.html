  <h3>Reference &amp; Practice Material</h3>
  <p>This week is about requisites. I take markup seriously, so to get you in the mood, <a href="https://resilientwebdesign.com/chapter2/">chapter two of <cite>Resilient Web Design</cite></a> that talks about how quickly designers forgot (or never knew) the meaning behind the elegance of these languages, and thus have and continue to abuse the hell out of it. If you've never before in your life seen <abbr title="hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr> or <abbr title="cascading stylesheets">css</abbr>, <mark>then you need to get through <a href="http://marksheet.io/">this tutorialright away</a>.</mark> Lastly, and I'll make a point of this, your assigned books are your companion; flip through them, scan them, <em>know them</em>. By the end of the semester they should be dog-eared and have coffee spills all over them. How much should you read? <strong>More.</strong></p>
