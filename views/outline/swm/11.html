    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>Last week we learned about scope and made a mouse trail. Here are some thinking activities to get warmed up.</p>
    <dl class="review t">
      <dt>Consider the function <code>appendChild</code></dt>
      <dd>What object does it belong to? What does it want as a parameter? What does it return?</dd>
      <dt>Consider the function <code>createElement</code></dt>
      <dd>What is it a method of? What parameter do you supply? What does it return?</dd>
      <dt>Consider the function <code>addEventListener</code></dt>
      <dd>What is it a method of? What parameters do you supply? Tell me extra about the second parameter.</dd>
      <dt>Considering <code>return</code> statements..</dt>
      <dd>Obviously you should know where and how to look return values in documentation. What is another way to find out what a function returns?</dd>

      <dt>Working with JSON</dt>
      <dd>This Lynda.com series is all about <abbr>JSON</abbr>. The <a href="http://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/What-JSON/114901/125761-4.html">first chapter</a> is a decent intro and also talks about some important tools that can help you use and debug JavaScript and JavaScript Objects.</dd>
      <dd><a href="https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Modifying-Array-objects-JavaScript/114901/125767-4.html">Chapter 2</a> talks about looping through and modifying objectsâ€”if you are unclear on how and why loops are so important, this will be worth your time.</dd>
      <dd><strong>Hint:</strong> If you are curious how to make a bigger final project, you might want to watch more videos and get a feel for <abbr title="Javascript object notation with padding">JSONP</abbr>, watch chapter 3 (we will not be using AJAX in this course).</dd>
