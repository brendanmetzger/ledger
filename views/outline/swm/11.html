    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>This week the ultimate goal is to create and interact with <abbr>html</abbr> through a program. Consider the following list:</p>
    <ul class="t b stylized star">
      <li><code>createElement</code></li>
      <li><code>appendChild</code></li>
      <li><code>addEventListener</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The preceding words are all functions. Do you know what their arguments are and what they return? If no, do you know how to find out?</p>

    <h3>Reference and Practice Material</h3>
    <p>You may research whatever area you see fit. <cite>Eloquent JavaScript</cite> has many sections that may be usefulâ€”forms for instance, in chapter 18. The <abbr>CSS</abbr> reference has advanced material that was not assigned, which may be worth looking into if you would like to polish up your navigation skills.</p>
