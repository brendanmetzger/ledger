    <p>Last Week we went over structure and outlining and introduced type and descendant selectors in <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr>. We are becoming comfortable the web development workflow and tools.</p>

    <h2>In Class Work</h2>
    <p>Use some time to play with the résumé  provided, and make sure you are able to do the implement and understand:</p>
    <ul class="stylized star t">
      <li>add multiple classes to one element</li>
      <li>use a type selector with a class</li>
      <li>use descendant selectors (class and type)</li>
      <li>use types, classes, and descendent selectors all together</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>References and Practice Materials</h2>
    <p class="intro">Here is the list of <a href="http://iam.colum.edu/brendan.metzger/vids/">previous lectures</a> that are available to watch.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><abbr title="hypertext markup language">html</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading stylesheet">CSS</abbr> Reference</dt>
      <dd>I've stressed how important workflow is, and now that we are a bit familiar with that stuff I'll begin my harping about research and documentation. Check out <a href="http://marksheet.io/">this site</a>, and read through <em>all</em> of the <abbr>html</abbr> and <abbr>css</abbr> sections by the end of the coming weeks.</dd>
      <dt>Navagation and styling links</dt>
      <dd>Depending on your proficiency, you may need to <a class="watch" href="http://www.lynda.com/CSS-tutorials/CSS-Styling-Navigation/90367-2.html">watch quite a few of these</a> to learn beyond just the nuts and bolts (or, you can jump to any specific areas if you think it will suit your needs better).</dd>
      <dt>Naming things</dt>
      <dd>It’s good to just watch multiple people do things. I post lots of links because I want you to observe different approaches to problem solving. One author only ever presents <em>a particular</em> approach, not <em>the</em> approach. Here is more stuff on <a class="watch" href="http://www.lynda.com/HTML-tutorials/Using-class-ID-attributes/182177/370839-4.html">classes and IDs</a></dd>

    <h3>Learning about Programming</h3>
    <p>Lynda.com has a great introduction to programming (general programming), but coincidentally beneficial to us, it uses JavaScript as the example language to illustrate the process and requirements. It’s highly relevant, and pretty friendly for beginners.</p>
    <p>Starting here, I want you to carefully watch <a href="http://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/What-programming/83603/90430-4.html">chapters 1–4</a> over the coming weeks. It is only about an hour and a half and it is slow and careful and will make the rest of the semester more enjoyable. In the videos that follow, you will see the speaker use some files, namely a <code>container.html</code> file and a <code>script.js</code> and he uses default text editor—stuff you already know all about!</p>
    <p>I hope this goes without saying, but the material I post down here <strong>is mandatory to review</strong>. By the time I get around to lecturing around JavaScript, you will need to have familiarized yourself with these concepts otherwise we'd need about 5 more classes for me to give a proper introduction.</p>
    <ul class="cross stylized t">
      <li>In your notes directory follow along with the videos—it never hurts.</li>
      <li>Use comments to keep notes within your code and separate chapters and exercises.</li>
      <li>The author makes extensive use of the <code>alert</code> function. I highly suggest you swap out <code>console.log</code> and get familiar with what it is doing (plus, all those dialogs are annoying and don’t keep a visual record of output).</li>
      <li>If you have questions, jot 'em.</li>
      <li>Every little bit of code should be organized, become serious about nitpicking yourself and you'll do wonderfully.</li>
    </ul>
