    <h2>Review/Questions</h2>
    <p>Last Week we went over structure and outlining and introduced type and descendant selectors in <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr>. We are becoming comfortable the web development workflow and tools.</p>

    <h2>Editing Calisthenics</h2>
    <p>We now are familiar with using command+arrow keys to jump around our editor. We know that holding shift down while doing this will select text. We are aware of indentation guides and invisible characters. If you are not aware of any of this stuff yet, or need a refresher: re-watch the lectures or ask me at any point if you need to clarify—this is the convenient stuff that will make your life easier!</p>
      <p>This week we are going to look at some of the things we can do with a text editor to optimize your workflow like adding packages and modifying snippits to work to our preferences. Though I use <a href="http://atom.io">Atom</a> in class, the important take away is all reputable program source code editors have packages, snippits, macros or some other system for doing pesky work for you.</p>

    <h2>Selectors: <em>Classes, IDs, and pseudo classes</em></h2>
    <p>Now that we are familiar with element selectors and HTML outlining structure, we take our first step towards naming things. Classes and IDs are added as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_attribute">attributes</a> to HTML Elements. Attributes are keywords followed by an = sign and a quoted string of text.</p>
    <p>Adding classes to elements is the most powerful way to style a document. Adding IDs is less important for styling and more important for targeting a unique (that means only one) element—which is especially useful in JavaScript and XML. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp">Pseudo-classes</a> are ways to style transient states, such as a user hovering over an element with <code>:hover</code>, or an element’s position in the hierarchy with <code>:first-child</code> They are called pseudo because you don’t add them, the browser kind of adds them for you when necessary.</p>
    <p>With <strong>well structured HTML</strong>, you need fewer elements to accomplish an elegant design through CSS—as opposed to sloppy HTML that mandates too many classes/ids and other selectors, and the less you write, the easier it is to maintain code. Some general rules of thumb that I think works great: if your CSS class doesn’t seem like it could apply to more than one element, you should rethink your approach. If your ID seems like it could apply to several things, you should rethink your approach. Lastly, I think you should steer clear of ID selectors for CSS, only use them to add meaning, uniqueness, and specificity to your markup.</p>

      <h2>Programming (baby) step #1: <em>An example of computability</em></h2>
      <p>I mentioned in the last outline that counting is a part of human history, and likewise, is the essential function of a computer. Allow me to cook up an example. Before I do any actual counting let's take a tour of the console and talk about writing programs for a moment.</p>
