    <h2>Survey &amp; Next Steps</h2>
    <p>I hope throughout the course of working on a midterm you have identified some weak spots and areas that you need to focus on. When faced with a blank canvas, it becomes incredibly easy to let frustrations get the better of us. I understand this all too well, but hopefully this exercise reinforces that once you get the ball rolling it becomes easier to apply new concepts.</p>

    <h2>References and Practice Material</h2>
    <p class="intro">Here is the list of <a href="http://iam.colum.edu/brendan.metzger/vids/">previous lectures</a> that are available to watch. A reminder: post midterm, we will begin actually using JavaScript, so you should have watched and read and practiced enough to let the mystery subside and be comfortable dealing with the basics: <code>variables</code>, <code>objects</code>, <code>arrays</code>, <code>conditions</code>, <code>operators</code>, <code>loops</code> and <code>functions</code>.</p>
