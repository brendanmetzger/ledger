    <h2>Smooth Scrolling</h2>
    <p class="indented">I've written a <a href="/javascript/smooth-scroll.js">smooth-scrolling snippet</a> that you can use if you like. This bit of code, like the way of JavaScript-based animation in general, will go the way of the dinosaur soon. Like transitions and keyframe animation, there is already a <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#scrolling"><abbr title="cascading stylesheets">CSS</abbr> spec</a> on the books to facilitate a transitioned scroll... the countdown begins. >For data on support for the css-scroll-behavior feature across the major browsers you can <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-scroll-behavior">check caniuse.com</a></p>
    <p>While investigating anchors, you should find some interest in the <code>:target</code> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target">pseudo-class</a>. Note above, text of the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> will be red if the document has #smooth-scrolling at the end of the url—very handy.</p>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p class="intro">The most important part of the way we write JavaScript is the notion of functions. Before we go down that road, we must understand a little bit about the namesake and the reasoning behind these methods. Functions are necessary, they are fascinating and they can even be beautiful.</p>
    <section class="container">
      <div class="______ float left indented">
        <p>In the beginning—and not particularly surprising considering the name—computers were primarily concerned with expediting rote computations. I've tried introducing functions in non-threatening ways, comparing them to cheeky things we know in real life; making pancakes and washing dishes—functions as routines. However, this doesn’t convey the the true import of functions, nor give much advice on how to use them correctly. Most often you’ll hear functions defined as <dfn>a principle of organizing code to make programs reusable, decrease errors and avoid duplication</dfn>.</p>
        <p>In a more rigorous way of thinking, such a definition equates authoring functions as a means of satisfying a <q>best practice,</q> but that’s a bit misleading. Clarity and organization are certainly a byproduct of abstracting code, not the reason to do it. In their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">purest form</a>, functions take input and return some sort of output. We already know about some functions already from the world of mathematics, so rather than invent a new function, perhaps it will be more beneficial to dissect an existing one.</p>

        <figcaption class="pad">A function can be thought of as a machine that takes something as input and returns output. Given the same input, it will always return the same output.</figcaption>

        <p>Let’s consider the <strong>cosine</strong>. Why is it a function, and what does that mean? Yes, it's a button on a calculator, but we can make our own cosine function using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">300 year old technique</a> (which is likely what most calculator buttons are implementing as well). Understanding the following code will allow you to walk away knowing a few things: there is no such thing as magic and small details can lead to big ideas.</p>
        <p>While looking at the formula below, the first mystery we’ll see is that the cosine function (denoted <em>cos(x)</em>) is really a composition of two other mathematical functions and repeatable process (a loop). Make sure you are able to spot these three elements: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function">the exponential function</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">and the factorial function</a>. Then, there are a few tricks like getting a number to flip from positive to negative, and all of a sudden you shave the time it takes to manually compute a cosine from about 15 minutes in 1715 to as fast as your fingers can move today.</p>

    <h2>Data &amp; The <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element</h2>
    <div class="three columns indented">
      <p>In this course, we will mostly be concerned with the basic use of forms to provide input and a point of interaction. It is worth briefly mentioning that they are actually quite complex, and necessarily so: the provide the interface to send huge amounts of information to a back-end server for storage, processing, payment and many other activities. For this reason, they have hundreds of attributes concerning data protection, validation, and accessibility. As such, they can be a bit overwhelming, so for a first pass, the introduction will be brief and any further interest can be self-directed. The Mozilla Developer Network has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms">nice guide</a> for creating forms if you are interested.</p>
      <p>Of fundamental concern to us as <em>interactive</em> designers and developers is a notion of input/output. We are quite familiar with the mouse/trackpad as an input device: x/y movement coordinates, clicking, selection and scrolling are executed through such devices. Considering the keyboard, we have the full range of a keystroke (down, up, and press) which can be executed on any key, and along with meta keys (option, command, control).</p>

    <h4>Inputs</h4>
    <p>Input is largely controlled via the <code>input</code> Element. The input is an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/empty_element">empty element</a>, and depending on the <code>type</code> attribute, it well exhibit a different function. For instance, <code>&lt;input type="text"...</code> is your basic text input field, where <code>&lt;input type="checkbox"...</code> would be a checkbox. You can make <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input">many types of input</a>, below is a quick overview of some interesting ones.</p>
    <dl class="whitepaper tt bb">
      <dt><pre class="prettyprint">&lt;input type="text" value="<span class="text input">content</span>"/&gt;</pre></dt>
      <dd><input type="text" value="content" class="example" oninput="document.querySelector('.text.input').textContent = this.value;" /></dd>
      <dd>The text input is your go-to for basic input. The value attribute holds whatever is typed into the box</dd>
      <dt><pre class="prettyprint checkbox">&lt;label&gt;&lt;input type="checkbox" value="mmm-hmmm"/&gt;check?&lt;/label&gt;</pre></dt>
      <dd><label><input type="checkbox" checked="checked" value="is checked" onclick="document.querySelector('pre.checkbox').classList.toggle('strike')"/>check?</label></dd>
      <dd>The checkbox is interesting: you set the value, and the value only is sent if the box is checked.</dd>
      <dd>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label">Label Element</a> provides additional functionality.</dd>
      <dt><pre class="prettyprint">&lt;input type="range" min="0" max="100" step="5" value="<span class="range input">50</span>"/&gt;</pre></dt>
      <dd><input type="range" min="5" max="100" step="5" value="50" oninput="document.querySelector('.range.input').textContent = this.value" /></dd>
      <dt><pre class="prettyprint">&lt;input type="color" value="<span class="color input">EE33AA</span>"/&gt;</pre></dt>
      <dd><input type="color" value="#EE33AA" oninput="document.querySelector('.color.input').textContent = this.value;" /></dd>
      <dt><pre class="prettyprint select"><![CDATA[<select>
  <option value="nothing">default</option>
  <option value="better">another option</option>
  <option value="medium">choose this</option>
</select>]]></pre></dt>
      <dd>
        <select oninput="alert('you chose: ' + this.value);">
          <option value="nothing">default</option>
          <option value="better">another option</option>
          <option value="medium">choose this</option>
        </select>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <h4>And More!</h4>
    <p>That is an extremely terse list; there are textareas, radio buttons, and many more types of input to do <strong>exactly what you intend</strong>. Knowing the inputs available and how to use them is an important part of interactive design and programming. Be sure to know about the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_eventattributes.asp">form events</a> available—in my examples above I am using the <code>oninput</code> events. You should understand what <code>blur</code> and <code>focus</code> mean, as well as using the form values.</p>
    <p class="focus t"><strong>Note:</strong> many used <code>onkeyup</code> (or down/press) listeners to do the turkish keyboard. Can you think of a way to use <code>oninput</code> and the <code>value</code> property to do something similar?</p>

    <h2>Case Study: JavaScript functions</h2>
    <p class="intro">One of the best uses of JavaScript is to disseminate information through interactivity. The following case study we will work on a few weeks at a time use functions and programming to make our jobs a little easier.</p>
    <p>I've spent a bit of time putting together <a href="http://codepen.io/brendanmetzger/full/XjvbaP/">this example</a> to help showcase interactivity and time management. It will be worth studying now so that we can refactor in the coming weeks and slowly learn the ropes when it comes to pragmatically thinking about ways to use interactivity to both solve problems and provide interesting design solutions.</p>
