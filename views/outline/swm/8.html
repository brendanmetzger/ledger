    <p>Hopefully you found time over break to refresh a little bit, no doubt bursting with excitement to be back in this windowless room staring at a backlit screen. This outline is around the theme of ways we can gather and use input to manipulate and provide output.</p>

    <h3>Reference &amp; Practice Material</h3>
    <p>The only mandatory reading I am assigning this week is <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html">Chapter 3 on Functions</a> in <cite>Eloquent JavaScript</cite>. This will give you time to follow along carefully with the examples as well as work backwards to the previous two chapters if anything is fuzzy.</p>
    <p>If you have an interest in styling forms and inputs, consult <strong>Chapter 11</strong> in the <cite>CSS Reference</cite>.</p>
