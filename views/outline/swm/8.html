    <h2>Reference and Practice Material</h2>
    <p class="intro">Here is the list of <a href="http://iam.colum.edu/brendan.metzger/vids/">previous lectures</a> that are available to watch. I gave some reference materials before the midterm to read, a few chapters regarding JavaScript and the Document Object Model. We’ll be going over <strong>Events</strong> next week. If you have not gone through that material yet, you should catch up as soon as possible.</p>

      <dd>Definitely View <a href="https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/What-functions/148137/158390-4.html">Chapter 1</a> of this Lynda.com series.</dd>
      <dd>If you are chomping at the bit to get on to advanced topics, I suggest you watch <a href="http://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Using-functions-objects/148137/158394-4.html">Chapter 2</a> as well.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html">Chapter 3</a> of Eloquent JavaScript </dt>
      <dd>This is a more terse, more advanced (yet still intended for beginners) primer on functions. It will cover advanced topics like call stacks, closure and recursion. You don’t need to understand them fully, but introduce yourself to these words.</dd>
