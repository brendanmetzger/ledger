    <p>Last we spoke we went over our midterms. Hopefully you found time over break to refresh a little bit, no doubt bursting with excitement to be back in this windowless room staring at a backlit screen.</p>

    <h2>Smooth Scrolling</h2>
    <p class="indented">I've written a <a href="/javascript/smooth-scroll.js">smooth-scrolling snippet</a> that you can use if you like. This bit of code, like the way of JavaScript-based animation in general, will go the way of the dinosaur soon. Like transitions and keyframe animation, there is already a <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/cssom-view/#scrolling"><abbr title="cascading stylesheets">CSS</abbr> spec</a> on the books to facilitate a transitioned scroll... the countdown begins.</p>
    <p>While investigating anchors, you should find some interest in the <code>:target</code> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:target">pseudo-class</a>. Note above, text of the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> will be red if the document has #smooth-scrolling at the end of the url—very handy.</p>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p class="intro">The most important part of the way we write JavaScript is the notion of functions. Before we go down that road, we must understand a little bit about the namesake and the reasoning behind these methods. Functions are necessary, they are fascinating and they can even be beautiful.</p>
    <section class="container">
      <div class="______ float left indented">
        <p>In the beginning—and not particularly surprising considering the name—computers were primarily concerned with expediting rote computations. I've tried introducing functions in non-threatening ways, comparing them to cheeky things we know in real life; making pancakes and washing dishes—functions as routines. However, this doesn’t convey the the true import of functions, nor give much advice on how to use them correctly. Most often you’ll hear functions defined as <dfn>a principle of organizing code to make programs reusable, decrease errors and avoid duplication</dfn>.</p>
        <p>In a more rigorous way of thinking, such a definition equates authoring functions as a means of satisfying a <q>best practice,</q> but that’s a bit misleading. Clarity and organization are certainly a byproduct of abstracting code, not the reason to do it. In their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">purest form</a>, functions take input and return some sort of output. We already know about some functions already from the world of mathematics, so rather than invent a new function, perhaps it will be more beneficial to dissect an existing one.</p>

        <figcaption class="pad">A function can be thought of as a machine that takes something as input and returns output. Given the same input, it will always return the same output.</figcaption>

      <p>We will spend the rest of class taking apart and thinking about a <strong>cosine</strong>, why it is a function, and what that means. We’ll make our own cosine function, all homemade, using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">300 year old technique</a>. I expect this to be challenging, but you’ll walk away knowing a few things: there is no such thing as magic and small details can lead to big ideas.</p>
      <p>While looking at the formula below, the first mystery we’ll see is that the cosine function (denoted <em>cos(x)</em>) is really a composition of two other mathematical functions and repeatable process (a loop). Make sure you are able to spot those three elements (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function">hint</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">hint</a>).</p>

    <h2>Learning JavaScript through Time Management</h2>
    <p>I've spent a bit of time putting together <a href="http://codepen.io/brendanmetzger/full/XjvbaP/">this example</a> to help showcase interactivity and time management.</p>

    <h2>Reference and Practice Material</h2>
    <p>I gave some reference materials before the midterm to read, a few chapters regarding JavaScript and the Document Object Model. We’ll be going over <strong>Events</strong> next week. If you have not gone through that material yet, you should catch up as soon as possible.</p>

      <dd>Definitely View <a href="https://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/What-functions/148137/158390-4.html">Chapter 1</a> of this Lynda.com series.</dd>
      <dd>If you are chomping at the bit to get on to advanced topics, I suggest you watch <a href="http://www.lynda.com/JavaScript-tutorials/Using-functions-objects/148137/158394-4.html">Chapter 2</a> as well.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html">Chapter 3</a> of Eloquent JavaScript </dt>
      <dd>This is a more terse, more advanced (yet still intended for beginners) primer on functions. It will cover advanced topics like call stacks, closure and recursion. You don’t need to understand them fully, but introduce yourself to these words.</dd>
