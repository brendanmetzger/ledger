    <h3>Preamble</h3>
    <p>For ten or fifteen minutes, review this week's material. From there, spend the first part of class gathering in groups of three and show your work in the semester thus far. Three weeks left, so this is a chance to gauge progress and see what every body else is up to and share successes or struggles.</p>
