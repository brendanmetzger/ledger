    <h2>Frameworks</h2>
    <p>Using frameworks falls into some distinct patterns—I realize this may be insulting, but it’s really quite accurate.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You don’t have time</li>
      <li>You don’t know how</li>
      <li>Usually Both</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The truth is that there is no shame in this, oftent we are just too proud to admit we don’t know everything (oddly, we have no trouble admiting we don’t have the time [though often that's exaggerated]). There are always problems that are difficult to solve and others have already solved in some fashion. With experience and time, frameworks become all but occasionally convenient, but without those two factors, they become quite necessary.</p>
    <p>There was a point in JavaScript development where different browsers implemented the <abbr title="document object model">DOM</abbr> differently—it was so ugly that you had either had to spend all your time fixing bugs or use a framework that did it for you. One such framework called jQuery still lives on despite the fact that most of what it does is simply habit over convenience anymore. And here in lies a caveat—when a framework prevents you from expanding your perspective, it is a different type of tool. It is a crutch, that alleviates an ailment, but doesn't provide a total advantage over someone who doesn't need one.</p>
    <p>This is an important point I make: we should use frameworks often, and enjoy using them, but take to heart, in a best case world, you write your own code. Take a humble moment every now and then to remember that and let it push you forward.</p>
