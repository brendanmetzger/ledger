    <h2>Frameworks</h2>
    <p class="intro">Programming with frameworks is sometimes like using a smoking-hot, 700º Weber to make a grilled cheese sandwich. A fancy instrument might earn nods of approval, but sandwiches are also described by ingredients and quality of said. A smoky, grilled sandwich might be delicious, but this is certainly not the best or only way to make it. My point; a sandwich and the tools used are separate ideas.</p>
    <div class="three columns indented">
      <p>Using a framework—from my experience—is only necessary in the following circumstance: a grand idea is conceived (or desired) but the requisite skill to implement said idea supersedes the skill necessary to make it happen. Working in our consumer-design culture without decades of experience and the necessary time available to prototype and learn, this is almost a guarantee. Luckily there are design solutions others have gone to great lengths to streamline and define a solution to almost any problem. Hang on that last thought: when others determine a solution, one should understand the pros and cons of that treatise.</p>
      <p>The benefits can be big, but to be clear, for that to happen the framework of choice <strong>must be constructed on top of a philosophy</strong>. That is, there is a method and a reason to the decisions made, and understanding the framework authors’ intention is the only successful way to implement such a tool.</p>
      <h4>How the most popular framework ever came to be</h4>
      <p>That wasn't always the case. There was a point in the earlier days of web development where different browsers implemented both <abbr>CSS</abbr> and the <abbr title="document object model">DOM</abbr> quite differently. Countless hours were spent fixing bugs and designing hacks so that one page would more or less function the same in different browsers. To save oursel or use a framework that fixed the bugs for you to give a consistent <abbr>api</abbr>. Long ago, in non-<abbr title="internet explorer">IE</abbr> to bind an event listener you would use our familiar <code>addEventListener</code>, but in Internet Explorer, you would use <code>addEvent</code>. The spec agreed it should be <code>addEventListener</code>, but marketshare allowed some bigger players to do whatever they wanted.</p>
      <p>So frameworks ironed this out for us—we didn’t have to write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code">spaghetti code</a> to grapple with inconsistencies. One such framework, say jQuery, might give us a new method called <code>on</code> that did all the event lister stuff for us,and more—it was a windfall at the time. Today, much of this is a non-issue, we can write nice clean, cross-browser code, but jQuery lives on because it has become very familiar.</p>
      <p>And this is a caveat I'd mention now; when a framework prevents you from expanding your perspective, it is an awkward tool. Like a crutch that alleviates an ailment, it won’t provide an advantage over someone who can function without one. I was an early proponent and enthusiast of any tool that makes us better, mind, there is a large gulf between <q>better</q> and <q>adequate</q> when it comes to proficiency.</p>
      <p>This is an important point I make: we should use frameworks often, and enjoy using them, but take to heart, in a best case world, you write your own code. Take a humble moment every now and then to remember that and let it push your design and your curiosity forward.</p>

    <h3 class="tt">A review</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JavaScript_libraries">list of JS frameworks</a> is long; I will boil down some interesting ones that I think have lasting value and indicate why.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="http://vanilla-js.com/">Vanilla JS</a></dt>
      <dd>A joke site used to talk about the state of the current language and that modern techniques available are actually more terse and straightforward, and efficient than the most popular frameworks.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a></dt>
      <dd>The most famous framework ever… with jQuery you go shopping for every plugin and interface widget ever made: light-boxes, carousels, parallax effects, oh my! Many people treat this as de-facto—which is never advisable in my opinion.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a></dt>
      <dd>Lots of people are talking about this. That’s all I can say, as I will shamefully admit, I can’t help but find it incredibly intimidating and generally, <a href="https://twitter.com/thomasfuchs/status/708675139253174273">overdoing it</a>.</dd>
      <dt>Drawing</dt>
      <dd><a href="http://snapsvg.io/">Snap <abbr>SVG</abbr></a> is a vector drawing framework (formerly called Raphaël). Scalable vector graphics are fun, but I daresay, a bit intimidating. This is a good toe-dip into that pool.</dd>
      
      <dd><a href="https://two.js.org/">Two.js</a> is more motion-graphics centered drawing api, meaning it has an animation loop, meaning, it is good for creating sequences to watch rather than interact with.</dd>
      <dd><a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> is a data-visualization library. Absolutely adored by data journalists, map geeks and statistics nerds.</dd>
      <dt>Games</dt>
      <dd>Someone has already compiled <a href="http://html5gameengine.com/">a list</a>—sorting by popularity will get showcase some of the better ones.</dd>
      <dt><a href="http://ramdajs.com/0.21.0/">Ramda</a></dt>
      <dd>Just because… This is a <em>functional</em> library, that allows you to program in an entirely new style. It’s part genius, bewildering, sometimes ridiculous and entirely fascinating.</dd>
