    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>Last week we covered class combinators and color, went over block vs inline vs. inline block once again and as well as introduced a bit of boolean logic.</p>
    <p>At this point in the semester, I have introduced the topics that I consider requisite and will spend less time revisiting and you’ll research and fill in the pieces as we go. We now know about the browser console, keeping it open while we develop. You know that HTML has a structure, and you are aware that careful indentation gives you a visual aid to interpret and see this structure. You are aware that there are semantic tags for to describe content and those tags have meaning.</p>

    <h3>Reference &amp; Practice Materials</h3>
    <p><strong>Chapter seven</strong> of the <cite><abbr>CSS</abbr></cite> book is to be read intimately, because the box-model is not to be misunderstood. There are so many <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model">write-ups</a> of the box-model. Some are <a href="http://adamschwartz.co/magic-of-css/chapters/1-the-box/">pretty</a>, but they all pretty much say <a  href="https://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/">the same thing</a>. Get the drift. All this is to say, we are on the precipice of having all of the tools necessary to <a href="http://learnlayout.com/no-layout.html">learn layout</a>—that is an easy click-through tutorial—check it out.</p>
    <p>For a dose of perspective on how why we should try as hard as ever, here is a <cite>Freakonomics</cite> podcast titled <a href="http://freakonomics.com/podcast/internet/">Is the Internet Being Ruined?</a></p>
