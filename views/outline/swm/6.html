    <h3>Preface</h3>
    <p>Before even considering how to move something with a program, think about it philosophically. Movement is defined as a change between states, like sitting on the left side of the room, we could call <var>state A</var>, and later perhaps, sitting on the right side of the room is <var>state B</var>. There are many ways to get from <var>state A</var> to <var>state B</var>. The easiest, is the instant transition; like the shutter of an eyelid, an object can <em>move</em> from the left side to the right. From there, things get interesting, as we can control many variables of that movement, most notably, <em>time</em>.</p>
    <p>The questions from here on out are <q>what can you change</q> and <q>when and how can you change something</q>. With that, here are the <a href="https://gist.github.com/brendanmetzger/09e232cf4ed6bc9950916350fd3b6d86">practice templates</a> that we will work on today.</p>
