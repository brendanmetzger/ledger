    <p class="intro">The goal of every interval is to add a little bit to our repertoire, building on fundamentals week by week. After an introduction to filesystems and networks, once on a server, a website’s raison d'être is to broadcast information, and that information must be marked up for a machine to parse and organize. Before focusing purely on style and aesthetic, it is important to understand the algorithm of how to begin structuring a document.</p>

    <h2>Review: Tools</h2>
    <p>Last week we were introduced to some tools used for web development. I will use <a href="http://atom.io">Atom</a> in this course. You learned about a few protocols, namely hypetext transfer protocol for using a browser to got files from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web servers</a> as well as the file transfer protocol for getting files <em>to and from</em> computers—typically a personal computer and a computer acting as a web server.</p>

      <h3>Keys to successful web-development</h3>
      <ul class="stylized star">
        <li>Learn about your text editor—watch a tutorial video—they have lots of helpful features.</li>
        <li>Try to use the mouse less and less every week</li>
        <li>Learn shortcuts for common tasks (saving files, refreshing browsers, switching between tabs, opening/closing files, etc.)</li>
        <li>Always have your browser console open when you are developing projects</li>

    <h2>Nodes into <abbr title="hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr></h2>
    <p>Your template files is full of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_(text)">boilerplate</a> that might seem like a formality, but it’s important to start understanding that <strong>marking up a document</strong> using a hierarchy of nodes is about explicity structure and meaning—not about style in the least. This serves two purposes: first to ensure a machine can parse the data, and second, to create objects that you can manipulate. We can change the <strong>look and feel</strong> of these objects through the use of a stylesheet language, and we can change the <strong>behavior</strong> of these objects through the use of a programming language. The nodes (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">html</abbr>) give structure and proper structure allows for powerful design and behavior modification. Perhaps unfortunately due to it's easiness to learn and write, sloppy and incorrect markup is quite easy to get away with so you should be extra careful to understand it conceptually so you can take advantage of the powerful tools it will provide as we learn more about controlling look/feel and behavior of applications.</p>
    <p>The first clue that gives credence to the importance of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents is this boilerplate—something that many developers, at best, neglect, and at worst, never truly learn. Every <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">html</abbr> file will be saved with a .html extension and will contain the following elements: <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. No other files we author requires such boilerplate; obviously it's there for a reason or we'd skip it! With that, we are going to look at markup from a very high level, and investigate the concept of what a <q>node</q> is, and then apply that concept to authoring documents.</p>

    <h2>A Primer on Sectioning and Outlining</h2>
    <p>Looking at information and developing a hierarchy is an important part of creating documents.</p>
    <p>I gleaned some stuff from wikipedia and put together a <a href="/student/structure/outline.txt" class="download">plain text outline</a> that we can look at to begin understanding how a well sectioned document is appealing in many ways.</p>
    <section>
      <h3>Sectioning Blocks</h3>
      <p></p>
      <dl>
        <dt><code>&lt;article&gt;</code></dt>
        <dd>The HTML &lt;article&gt; element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, <mark>an object, or any other independent item of content</mark>. Each &lt;article&gt; should be identified, typically by including a heading (&lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt; element) as a child of the &lt;article&gt; element.</dd>
        <dt> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article">documentation</a>)</dt>
        <dt><code>&lt;header&gt;</code> (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header">documentation</a>)</dt>
        <dt><code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></dt>
        <dt><code>&lt;nav&gt;</code></dt>
      </dl>
      <h3>Headings, Paragraphs, etc.</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt><code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code>,<code>&lt;h5&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code></dt>
        <dt>em, i</dt>
        <dd>adds an italicized face to text. Semantically, em means 'emphasis', where i just means you want a visual distinction (em is usually the way to go)</dd>
        <dt>strong, b</dt>
        <dd>adds a bold face to text. Semantically, strong carries more meaning, b is just visual.</dd>
        <dt>p</dt>
        <dd>represents paragraphs</dd>
        <dt>a</dt>
        <dd>hyperlinks are added via the a tag, and links are facilitated through an href attribute.</dd>

    <h2>Anatomy of the cascading stylesheet language</h2>
    <p>There are essentially two things that make a stylesheet work, the first is the <strong>selector</strong>, and once the selector has found its target, you can begin modify the targets <strong>properties</strong>. Become familiar with those two terms, I will say <strong>selector</strong> and <strong>property</strong> with some frequency. Selector means <q>find this node</q> and properties means <q>adjust the way this thing looks</q>.</p>
    <h3 class="tt">Selectors</h3>
    <p>Selectors are the handles that target specific <abbr title="Hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr> Element Nodes. Specific means anything from one element such as <code>#special { ...props</code> to literally every element, with something like <code>* { ...props</code>. Selectors can be concatenated with a comma to apply one set of property settings to several selectors—concatenating the previous examples would look like so: <code>#special, * { ...props</code>. Selectors are a heady topic, and one that we will be spending easily the next five weeks on.</p>
    <h3>Properties</h3>
    <p>Properties are simply the things we can adjust—these are truly the styles in stylesheet.</p>
    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <p>Stylesheet languages, like Markup Languages, are quite forgiving, which we'll never use to our advantage. A typo in these languages isn't treated as a big deal, but I see it as one.</p>

    <h2>Typographic Properties</h2>
    <p>It has been written that <a href="https://ia.net/know-how/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period">Web Design is 95% typography</a> and giving some weight to that claim is the amount of leverage you have for controlling the typographic experience.</p>
    <section class="container">
      <dl class="______ float left">
        <dt><code>font-size</code> property</dt>
        <dd>Font-size sets the size of the text. Other properties can be based off of this size; when you declare a font-size for a particular element, that size will govern how all other properties are set when using a unit such as <code>em</code></dd>
        <dt>font-family</dt>
        <dd>Changes the typeface of an element. Specify this as a sequences of typefaces.</dd>
        <dt>font-weight</dt>
        <dd>Controls weight thin/normal/bold, or in 3 digit numbers like 200, 400, 800 (preferred, especially for full typefaces with more than three weights)</dd>
        <dt><code>line-height</code> property (leading)</dt>
        <dd>Usage is <code>line-height: (num)<em>unit</em>;</code></dd>
        <dd>Unlike print typography dominated by baselines, web typography is dominated by this unit. Mostly, you will use to control <q>leading</q>, or the space between lines. </dd>
        <dd><code>line-height</code> need not be a fixed number, it can also be a unit-less ratio such as <code>1.5</code> which would represent 1.5 times the value of whatever the <code>font-size</code> is—handy!</dd>
        <dt><code>letter-spacing</code> property (tracking)</dt>
        <dt><code>text-align</code></dt>
        <dd>Used to align left, center, right align, as well as justify text. You can only align text in block-level elements.</dd>
        <dt><code>text-transform</code></dt>
        <dd>Offers transform to upper/lowercase, can capitalize a sentence, etc.</dd>
        <dt><code>text-decoration</code></dt>
        <dd>Controls underline, line-through, overline, etc.</dd>
        <dt><code>text-indent</code></dt>
        <dd>set the indentation using a CSS unit.</dd>
      </dl>
      <div class="____ float left examples">
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <div style="font-size:16px;line-height:1.5">
          <input type="range" min="10" max="30" step="2" value="16" oninput="this.parentNode.style.fontSize = this.nextElementSibling.querySelector('span').innerHTML = this.value + 'px'"/>I have specified the size in pixels or <code>font-size: <span>16px</span>;</code>. This is for the sake of example—I <strong>always</strong> use a relative unit for setting text size, such as <code>em</code>/<code>rem</code>, or the viewport units such as <code>vw</code> or <code>vh</code></div>
        <div style="line-height:1.35" data-banner="preferred">
          <input type="range" min="0" max="3" step="0.125" value="1.35" oninput="this.parentNode.style.lineHeight = this.nextElementSibling.querySelector('span').innerHTML = this.value"/>This is a bit of text with a line-height of 1.35, or <code>line-height: <span>1.35</span>;</code>. Unit-less values are useful for some advanced reasons, but essentially, the ensure proportionality based on the text size.</div>
        <div style="line-height:1em">This is a bit of text with a line-height of 1em, or <code><samp>selector</samp> { line-height: 1em; }</code>. Notice that 1em is essentially at a point where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descender">descenders</a> of the previous line are nearly touching the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascender_(typography)">ascenders</a> of the lines below.</div>
        <div>
          <input type="range" min="-0.2" max="0.5" step="0.075" value="0" oninput="this.parentNode.style.letterSpacing = this.nextElementSibling.querySelector('span').innerHTML = this.value + 'em'"/>
          Adjust the slider to see the letter spacing <code>letter-spacing: <span>0</span>;</code>. I prefer <code>em</code>s for all typographic work, but some leave delicate operations like this to <code>px</code>.</div>

    <h2><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>: Descendant Selectors and Typography</h2>
    <h3>Declaring <abbr title="Cascating Stylesheets">CSS</abbr></h3>
    <p>Glancing at an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Syntax">overview of the syntax</a>, the declaration of a <abbr>CSS</abbr> ruleset resembles a programming data structure to some degree. Curly braces, colons, semicolons and careful use of punctuation operators is the starting point. From the onset, organization and code conventions are not only important, but mandatory for this course.</p>
    <h3>Units (of measure)</h3>
    <p>There are several <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/units.en.html"><abbr>CSS</abbr> units</a>, but you really only need to get comfortable with a handful of them.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>px (pixels)</dt>
      <dt>em</dt>
      <dd>an em is the width of a letter 'M', it is percentage based, so it is good for responsive design</dd>
      <dt>%</dt>
      <dd>Percentages are tough to get the hang of. They generally work well, and I would recommend them for widths.</dd>
      <dt>vh, vw, vmax, vmin</dt>
      <dd>A percentage of the viewport height and viewport width respectively. This is a handy one.</dd>

    <h2>Javascript &amp; Programming: The briefest introduction.</h2>
    <p class="intro discuss">As humans, have you ever wondered <strong>why do we count to 10?</strong>. Is there a better way?</p>
    <p>The fascinating thing is that there are many ways to count, in fact, an infinite number of ways, and ancient peoples had different methods, usually best suited to their needs and commerce. It wasn't until the 20<sup>th</sup> century after decades and decades of understanding the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">boolean algebra</a> that people began realizing a machine could be able to count for us. Modern computers are essentially very complicated clocks; they turn electricity into a trove of circuits that at the most basic level tick billions of times a second and thus, can count pretty fast.</p>
