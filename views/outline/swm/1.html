    <p class="intro">Every interval we will add more to our repertoire, building on fundamentals week by week. After an introduction to filesystems and networks, once on a server, a website’s raison d'être is to broadcast information, and that information must be marked up for a machine to parse and organize. This is not a question of style and aesthetic, it is about communication.</p>

    <h3>Review/Questions</h3>
    <p>Last week we were introduced to some tools used for web development. I will use <a href="http://atom.io">Atom</a> in this course. You learned about a few protocols, namely hypetext transfer protocol for using a browser to got files from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web servers</a> as well as the file transfer protocol for getting files <em>to and from</em> computers—typically a personal computer and a computer acting as a web server.</p>

      <h3>Keys to successful web-development</h3>
      <ul class="stylized star">
        <li>Learn about your text editor—watch a tutorial video—they have lots of helpful features.</li>
        <li>Try to use the mouse less and less every week</li>
        <li>Learn shortcuts for common tasks (saving files, refreshing browsers, switching between tabs, opening/closing files, etc.)</li>
        <li>Always have your browser console open when you are developing projects</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>References and Practice Materials</h2>
    <p class="intro">Here is the list of <a href="http://iam.colum.edu/brendan.metzger/vids/">previous lectures</a> that are available to watch.</p>

      <dt>A Web Development Primer</dt>
      <dd>This course, while having no pre-requisites, will move at a good clip. If you are rusty, new, or want to be really prepared, I highly (highly) suggest you spend a good chunk of time going over <a href="http://marksheet.io/introduction.html">how the web works</a>, <a href="http://marksheet.io/html-basics.html">HTML basics</a>, and <a href="http://marksheet.io/html-content.html">HTML content</a>.</dd>

      <dt>HTML Elements</dt>
      <dd>The Mozilla Developer Network has a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">comprehensive list</a> of elements—no need to memorize, <strong>absolutely spend some time reviewing this list</strong>.</dd>

      <dt>Sectioning and Outlining</dt>
      <dd>Many developers suffer from a syndrome known as divitis, which is an overuse of <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements. While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Span_and_div">span and div are handy</a>, and do fulfill a role, conscientious web developers engage in semantic markup, starting with using proper <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines">sections and outlines</a>.</dd>

      <dt>Javascript and the Browser</dt>
      <dd>Though it’s <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/12_browser.html">Chapter 12</a> of a JavaScript Programming book, I think it serves as a perfect starting point for the level of thinking we need to engage in, and that is the notion of networks, servers, clients and protocols.</dd>
