    <p class="intro">Any website’s raison d'être is to broadcast information, and that information must be marked up for a machine to parse and organize. This is not a question of style and aesthetic, it is about communication. Communicating is actually a difficult art form, much harder than today’s concept: structuring lots of individual pieces into a big idea.</p>

    <h3>Review &amp; Warm Up</h3>
    <p>Last week some tools used for web development (servers and text editors) and concepts surrounding filesystems and networks. For tools I will use <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a> and <a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a>—not because they are the best, but they have useful features I think many of you will appreciate.  I actually prefer that you use whatever tools you feel most comfortable with, so if you feel comfortable with something else and it meets our course objectives, then use it.</p>
    <p>You learned about a few protocols, namely hypetext transfer protocol for using a browser to got files from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server">web servers</a> as well as the file transfer protocol for getting files <em>to and from</em> computers—typically a personal computer and a computer acting as a web server.</p>

      <h3>Keys to successful web-development</h3>
      <ul class="stylized star">
        <li>Learn about your text editor—watch a tutorial video—they have lots of helpful features.</li>
        <li>Try to use the mouse less and less every week</li>
        <li>Learn shortcuts for common tasks (saving files, refreshing browsers, switching between tabs, opening/closing files, etc.)</li>
        <li>Always have your browser console open when you are developing projects</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Investigating Inline Elements</h2>
    <p class="intro">Inline elements are for wrapping up text. If surrounding a bunch of other <abbr>html</abbr> Elements with one of these darlings, then you are on the wrong track.</p>

    <h3>Reference &amp; Practice Material</h3>
    <p>I trust that you have throughly gone over the template and know the size and scope of the rest of the work for the semester. I have set up <a href="https://thirty-cc.slack.com/shared_invite/MTM1MDczNzA0ODg2LTE0ODU3OTkwOTEtYWVmZjA0YjM1YQ">Slack team</a> where we should start directing our concerns regarding tools, how-tos, debugging, and help needed. <mark>This tool is for you, not me—I urge anyone and everyone to ask and answer questions that you desire a more immediate response.</mark> For reading, I would breeze through <strong>chapters one and two</strong> of your <abbr>CSS</abbr> book. Then sit down and carefully read <strong>chapter six</strong>, because as they say, <a href="https://ia.net/know-how/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period">Web Design is 95% typography</a>. Concerning the <abbr>html5</abbr> reference, read <strong>chapter one</strong>.</p>
    <p>To reinforce the point about how we must appreciate networks and localhosts, here is graphically bedazzled video rundown of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K64fWX5z4U"><abbr>http</abbr> and <abbr>html</abbr></a>, courtesy of Khan Academy.</p>
