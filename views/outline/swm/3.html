    <h3>Reference &amp; Practice Material</h3>
    <p>In your <cite><abbr>CSS</abbr></cite> book you are extremely familiar with <strong>Appendix A</strong>. Do not stop there, you must be intimately aware of how much you can do with graphics, so read <strong>chapter eight</strong>. Skim <strong>chapter three</strong> and <strong>chapter five</strong> of the <cite><abbr>html5</abbr></cite> book.</p>
    <p>Concerning JavaScript, programming is painfully abstract to many people. So before we go down that road, watch Brett Victor give this fascinating presentation titled <cite><a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle</a></cite>. His primary thesis is that programming tools aren't very good at showing the meaning behind programming. Even though this is <em>not</em> how programming works, I think it will be good to see what manipulating odd syntax can do.</p>
