    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>Last week we went over classes and ID’s, naming conventions and you began an introduction to programming. Because they are so important, we are going to open up the resumé from last week and cover classes and ids some more, as well as go over the concept of a jump-nav</p>

        <h3>Use all your Elements</h3>
        <p class="_______ float left pad">A quick reminder, <strong><code>div</code> and <code>span</code></strong>, while very important and useful to design, have no inherent meaning. Many—professionals even—overuse them unnecessarily. Remember, you’re first goal is to add semantic value to your markup and to generate good data. If there is a better substitute for the tag you are using, use it, ie <code>&lt;div class="address"&gt;</code> is not a better option than <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>. Make a habit of searching for and reviewing the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Elements available</a> whenever you are writing markup.</p>

        <h3>Semantic <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">html</abbr></h3>
        <p class="pad">There are many important reasons to write your markup semantically, and while one reason may have more personal importance to you than another together they make a pretty compelling case as to why this is <strong>requisite</strong>, not just a good idea. <q cite="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/03/fight-div-itis-and-class-itis-with-the-960-grid-system/">Clear, lean code offers many advantages. It’s easy to fix, quick to download and causes fewer problems across different types of browsers. Relevant tags help screen readers, search engines and mobile devices interpret meaning in addition to layout.</q></p>

          <h4>Semantic structure is algorithmic</h4>
          <p>If not obvious by now, structuring a tree structure correctly means that a machine can make assumptions and parse a document efficiently. The obvious machine that comes to mind is a search engine.</p>
          <h4 class="tt">Semantic structure is data</h4>
          <p>Sloppy or improper use of an <abbr>html</abbr> <code>Element</code> will beget redundant and inconsistent <abbr>css</abbr> application. Further, imprecise, arbitrary use of <abbr >html</abbr> is an <strong>imprecise, arbitrary dataset</strong>. Now, I suppose it is quite evident at this point (or will be soon) that JavaScript is a programming language. What may not be clear to a novice, is that programs are almost completely useless <em>without structured data</em>.</p>
          <h4 class="tt">Semantic structure is thoughtful</h4>
          <p>Something we think about far too little, especially on the path to becoming designers is this fact: one-fifth of our society has a disability. Whether a user is born with or has acquired a paralytic disorder, or a vision or cognitive impairment, or has some other technological barrier, nobody should be barred from participation. Far too often the design community forgets this, sometimes out of arrogance, sometimes out of laziness. Well-structured documents help assistive technologies parse and deliver content as intended.</p>

    <h3>Embedding Images</h3>
    <p>Images are very easy to work with, in fact, optimizing and saving images (say, in Photoshop) is actually difficult—and beyond the scope of this course. As such let’s just revisit the basic embed of an image.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
      &lt;img src="valid/path.(jpg|png|gif|svg)" title="description" alt="alternative text (describe the image)"/&gt;

    <h3>Embedding Audio/video</h3>
    <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org#the-audio-element">Audio</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org#the-video-element">video</a> are only slightly more complicated. Depending on your format, you may have to supply multiple video types, but for the vast majority of users, an mp3 or m4a will work for audio or a mp4 for video.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
      &lt;audio src="valid/path.(mp3|m4a)" controls="controls"&gt;
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
      &lt;/audio&gt;

      &lt;video src="valid/path.(mp4|mov)" controls="controls" poster="valid/path..(jpg|png|gif|svg)"&gt;
        Your browser does not support the audio element.

    <h2><abbr title="Cascading Stylesheet">CSS</abbr> Units: <em>color</em></h2>
    <p>While we understand length and size units (px, em, vw, wh, %) another important value to understand how to set is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value">color</a>.</p>
    <p>I recommend that if you are new to color, you start by using and understanding how hex colors are specified. Hex stands for hexadecimal, and essentially it is just the red, green and blue system converted to the condensed hexadecimal number system. Once you understand this in principle, I think it is useful to use rgb values for the fact that you can specify an alpha channel—or an opacity of the color. From there, you can use an entirely different color scheme like hsl, or hue, saturation, luminosity. I won’t dwell on this system yet, but it can be much easier to use HSL when we begin programming in the future.</p>
    <h3 class="tt">Colorful Displays</h3>
    <p>In our displays, we use a three channel color system, each channel can hold 8 bits. That is, the red channel has 8 bits, the green channel has 8 bits, and the blue channel has 8 bits. 8 bits are quite important, and to a large extent, understanding 8 bits in a few different ways is all we need to get the gist of color.</p>
    <p>Before we analyze a few methods, let’s look at what 8 bits actually looks like a few different ways. In binary, it is an 8 digit number: <code>00000000</code>. Remember, a bit is a binary digit, which is a 0 or 1. We can count in binary, so essentially, each channel can count up to <code>11111111</code>. That same number, converted to decimal is <code>255</code>. That number in hex is, interestingly, <code>FF</code>.</p>
    <p>Use the table below to start exploring colors and how they work.</p>
    <div class="container t ruled top">
      <div class="one-third float left note">
        <h3>Hexadecimal</h3>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">Hexadecimal</a>, or base 16 is yet another method of counting, one in which we have 16 distinct digits instead of our familiar 0–9, and they are <em>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F</em>.</p>
        <p>To specify a color, you concatenate three hex values in order from red to green to blue. 0 is black (no value), FF is is the highest value, ie., white is <code>#FFFFFF</code></p>
      </div>
      <div class="one-third float left note">
        <h3><abbr title="red green blue">rgb</abbr> and <abbr title="red green blue alpha">rgba</abbr></h3>
        <p>Red Green Blue is the long form of the hex system, but works in almost the same way. Instead of using hex, you use decimal. 0 is still black, but this time 255 is the upper limit, ie., white is <code>rgb(255, 255, 255)</code></p>
        <p>A very advantageous use of the rgb system is that you can add an alpha channel, or opacity. <code>rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5)</code> would specify white at 50% opacity. <strong>This is handy.</strong></p>
      </div>
      <div class="one-third float left note">
        <h3><abbr title="hue saturation lightness">hsl</abbr> and <abbr title="hue saturation lightness alpha">hsla</abbr></h3>
        <p>This is the new kid on the block, and has some interesting applications with JavaScript. I don’t use it as much for my regular color assignments, but that could be mostly out of habit. <abbr>HSL</abbr> can be easier to work with from memory, as the saturation and lighness components are just components of the hue. Like rgb, you may specify an alpha channel.</p>

    <h2>Editing Calisthenics</h2>
    <p>This week we are going to look at some of the things we can do with a text editor to optimize your workflow like adding packages and modifying snippits to work to our preferences. Though I use <a href="http://atom.io">Atom</a> in class, the important take away is all reputable program source code editors have packages, snippits, macros or some other system for doing pesky work for you.</p>

    <h2 class="centered"><abbr>css</abbr> combinators</h2>
    <p>We are familiar with descendant selectors, something like <code>article section</code> will allow us to style all any section so long as it has an article as an <mark>ancestor</mark>. Much of the time, this can be more than we want, but luckily we can limit the reach of the descendant chain with the use of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_selectors">Child Selector</a>. By simply changing our previous selector to <code>article &gt; section</code> we only select sections that are direct children of an article. If you’re not familiar with the difference between children and descendants yet, hit the books.</p>
    <p>While not as immediately useful, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_selectors">adjacent sibling selectors</a> can be utilized to apply classes based on if elements are directly next to each other. An example would be adding a top border all but the first element of a list with <code>li + li { border-top: 1px solid #000; }</code>. If say, you wanted all the paragraphs following the first one to have an indent, but couldn’t be sure that it would be only p tags, you could switch to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_selectors">general sibling selectors</a> and use a selector like <code> p ~ p { text-indent: 1em; }</code>.</p>

    <h3>With CSS</h3>
    <p>Last week, we saw that adding a type selector directly adjacent to a class selector, ie. <code>h3.special { … }</code> says something like <q>only apply the class named special if the element is an h3</q>. Fixate for a moment on the word <b>if</b> and note that it implies there is a condition of true or false happening.</p>
    <p>This, along with other careful use of classes can simulate boolean behavior with <abbr>CSS</abbr>, and can be used to great effect—which is why I think <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/6-current-options-css-preprocessors/"><abbr>css</abbr> preprocessors</a> (programs that write <abbr>css</abbr> for you) are somewhat unnecessary. Written way back in the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr>css</abbr> 2.0 spec: <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#class-html"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> gives so much power to the <q>class</q> attribute, that authors could conceivably design their own <q>document language</q> based on elements with almost no associated presentation.</q> Broken down, the rules that inform how you may apply classes are so powerful that we could introduce meta-level thinking (not you actually would, or should.)</p>

    <h3>With Javascript</h3>
    <p>Boolean Algebra, the namesake of George Boole, a 19th century mathematician who pioneered the system of logical operations, can take complicated sets of logic and break them into a fundamental binary solution that can only be one of two values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. These <strong>Boolean values</strong> have straightforward properties, but as you combine them and use the algebraic systems, they quickly escalate in complexity.</p>

    <h3>Coercion</h3>
    <p>While not particularly useful to a beginner programmer, type coercion is often a <em>misunderstood and misused</em> part of programming languages. In JavaScript, you have the following primitive types at your disposal: <code>number</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>. Trying to use any non-boolean type in a logical operation (any operation that uses a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators">logical operator</a>) may produce unexpected results as they are cast to booleans for comparison. Depending on the value they might be considered <mark class="strong">truthy</mark> or <mark class="strong">falsy</mark>. As you begin, try very hard not to rely on coercion until you understand it intuitively. In the meantime, here is a table to start getting familiar:</p>
      <table class="full">
        <tbody>

    <p class="intro">Here is the list of <a href="http://iam.colum.edu/brendan.metzger/vids/">previous lectures</a> that are available to watch.</p>
    <p>You have at this time been exposed to a great deal of documentation regarding Hypertext Markup Language and Cascading Stylesheets. You have links to tutorials and other great resources in past outlines—I urge you to continue referencing those. To start making strides towards the substance of this course (scripting), I'm listing the next four chapters of the video series I assigned last week. <strong>I urge you to answer my forward thinking questions in your readme</strong>.</p>

        <dt><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Breaking-your-code-apart/83603/90452-4.html">Chapter 5 / Modular Code</a></dt>
        <dd>This chapter introduces functions, <q cite="http://eloquentjavascript.net">the bread and butter of JavaScript programming</q> (that means they are indispensable)</dd>
        <dd><strong>Forward thinking:</strong> Why are functions so important to JavaScript?</dd>
        <dt><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Introduction-iteration/83603/90458-4.html">Chapter 6 / Iteration</a></dt>
        <dd>Iteration, or Enumeration, is a fairly straight-forward concept, but take note of the examples the speaker gives.</dd>
        <dd><strong>Forward thinking</strong>: We think of loops things that just count; list things besides numbers that you'd would want to iterate?</dd>
        <dt><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Cleaning-up-string-concatenation/83603/90462-4.html">Chapter 7 / More Strings</a></dt>
        <dd>This chapter introduces ideas about how you operate on strings. A mistake beginning programmers often make is to think of a string as nothing more than a sentence. Believe it or  not, simple algorithms are often employed to weed out job applicants by asking to solve simple string problems.</dd>
        <dd><strong>Forward thinking:</strong> Why is it called a string?</dd>
        <dt><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Working-arrays/83603/90466-4.html">Chapter 8 / Collections</a></dt>
        <dd>This chapter introduces an <code>array</code>, which will be your first (obvious) taste of a data-structure.</dd>
        <dd><strong>Forward thinking:</strong> You are familiar with some array-like things you've worked on already. What are they?</dd>
