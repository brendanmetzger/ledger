    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>Last week we went over classes and ID’s, naming conventions and you began an introduction to programming. Because they are so important, we are going to continue the work started last week and investigate further applications of stylesheets to structured data. Before all that, I want to introduce some <a href="#import-of-counting">brain melting</a> material and give everyone a conceptual taste of programming.</p>
    <p>A preliminary discussion of the box-model is on the docket; with it is a push towards understanding the facilities of background images and a careful examination of units and how you <a href="https://gist.github.com/brendanmetzger/4cc5badd8dd0236cc24b9a8ded307df4">can visualize them carefully.</a></p>

    <h3>Reference &amp; Practice Material</h3>
    <p>In your <cite><abbr>CSS</abbr></cite> book you are extremely familiar with <strong>Appendix A</strong>. Do not stop there, you must be intimately aware of how much you can do with graphics, so read <strong>chapter eight</strong>. Skim <strong>chapter three</strong> and <strong>chapter five</strong> of the <cite><abbr>html5</abbr></cite> book.</p>
