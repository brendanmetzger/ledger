    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>Last week we went over classes and ID’s, naming conventions and you began an introduction to programming. Because they are so important, we are going to open up the resumé from last week and cover classes and ids some more, as well as go over the concept of a jump-nav</p>

    <h2>References and Practice Material</h2>
    <p class="intro">Here is the list of <a href="http://iam.colum.edu/brendan.metzger/vids/">previous lectures</a> that are available to watch.</p>
    <p>You have at this time been exposed to a great deal of documentation regarding Hypertext Markup Language and Cascading Stylesheets. You have links to tutorials and other great resources in past outlines—I urge you to continue referencing those. To start making strides towards the substance of this course (scripting), I'm listing the next four chapters of the video series I assigned last week. <strong>I urge you to answer my forward thinking questions in your readme</strong>.</p>

        <dt><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Breaking-your-code-apart/83603/90452-4.html">Chapter 5 / Modular Code</a></dt>
        <dd>This chapter introduces functions, <q cite="http://eloquentjavascript.net">the bread and butter of JavaScript programming</q> (that means they are indispensable)</dd>
        <dd><strong>Forward thinking:</strong> Why are functions so important to JavaScript?</dd>
        <dt><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Introduction-iteration/83603/90458-4.html">Chapter 6 / Iteration</a></dt>
        <dd>Iteration, or Enumeration, is a fairly straight-forward concept, but take note of the examples the speaker gives.</dd>
        <dd><strong>Forward thinking</strong>: We think of loops things that just count; list things besides numbers that you'd would want to iterate?</dd>
        <dt><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Cleaning-up-string-concatenation/83603/90462-4.html">Chapter 7 / More Strings</a></dt>
        <dd>This chapter introduces ideas about how you operate on strings. A mistake beginning programmers often make is to think of a string as nothing more than a sentence. Believe it or  not, simple algorithms are often employed to weed out job applicants by asking to solve simple string problems.</dd>
        <dd><strong>Forward thinking:</strong> Why is it called a string?</dd>
        <dt><a href="http://www.lynda.com/Developer-Programming-Foundations-tutorials/Working-arrays/83603/90466-4.html">Chapter 8 / Collections</a></dt>
        <dd>This chapter introduces an <code>array</code>, which will be your first (obvious) taste of a data-structure.</dd>
        <dd><strong>Forward thinking:</strong> You are familiar with some array-like things you've worked on already. What are they?</dd>
