    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>Last week we went over classes and ID's, naming conventions and began an introduction to programming.</p>

    <h2>Semantic <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">html</abbr></h2>
    <p class="intro pad">There are many important reasons to write your markup semantically, and while one reason may have more personal importance to you than another together they make a pretty compelling case as to why this is <strong>requisite</strong>, not just a good idea. <q cite="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2010/03/fight-div-itis-and-class-itis-with-the-960-grid-system/">Clear, lean code offers many advantages. It’s easy to fix, quick to download and causes fewer problems across different types of browsers. Relevant tags help screen readers, search engines and mobile devices interpret meaning in addition to layout.</q></p>
    <section class="two columns whitepaper">
      <h4>Semantic structure is algorithmic</h4>
      <p>If not obvious by now, structuring a tree structure correctly means that a machine can make assumptions and parse a document efficiently. The obvious machine that comes to mind is a search engine.</p>
      <h4 class="ruled top">Semantic structure is data</h4>
      <p>Sloppy or improper use of an <abbr>html</abbr> <code>Element</code> will beget redundant and inconsistent <abbr>css</abbr> application. Further, imprecise, arbitrary use of <abbr >html</abbr> is an <strong>imprecise, arbitrary dataset</strong>. Now, I suppose it is quite evident at this point (or will be soon) that JavaScript is a programming language. What may not be clear to a novice, is that programs are almost completely useless <em>without a dataset</em>. An imprecise arbitrary dataset is essentially nonsense, so for those of us who want to be programmers I want some extra thought put in to what this means.</p>
      <h4 class="ruled top">Semantic structure is thoughtful</h4>
      <p>Something we think about far too little, especially on the path to becoming designers is this fact: one-fifth of our society has a disability. Whether a user is born with or has acquired a paralytic disorder, or a vision or cognitive impairment, or has some other technological barrier, nobody should be banned from participation because of corner-cutting. Far too often the design community forgets this, and it is nothing short of arrogant. Well-structured documents help assistive technologies parse and deliver content as intended.</p>

      <h2>Elements</h2>
      <p class="_______ float left pad">A quick reminder, <strong><code>div</code> and <code>span</code></strong> have no inherent meaning. Many—professionals even—overuse them as a crutch. Remember, you're first goal is to add semantic value to your markup and to generate good data. If there is a better substitute for the tag you are using, use it. I will never penalize for using the wrong tag, but I will begin penalizing for usage of div/span when there is a better alternative. If you haven't made a habit of searching for or reviewing the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">Elements available</a>, then you should start.</p>

    <h2>Media</h2>
    <h3>Embedding Images</h3>
    <p>Images are very easy to work with, in fact, optimizing and saving images (say, in Photoshop) is actually difficult—and beyond the scope of this course. As such let's just revisit the basic embed of an image.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
      &lt;img src="valid/path.(jpg|png|gif|svg)" title="description" alt="alternative text (describe the image)"/&gt;
    </pre>
    <h3>Embedding Audio/video</h3>
    <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio">Audio</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video">video</a> are only slightly more complicated. Depending on your format, you may have to supply multiple video types, but for the vast majority of users, an mp3 or m4a will work for audio or a mp4 for video.</p>
    <pre class="prettyprint">
      &lt;audio src="valid/path.(mp3|m4a)" controls="controls"&gt;
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
      &lt;/audio&gt;

      &lt;video src="valid/path.(mp4|mov)" controls="controls" poster="valid/path..(jpg|png|gif|svg)"&gt;
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
      &lt;/video&gt;

  <article class="two columns indented">
    <h2 class="centered"><abbr>css</abbr> combinators</h2>
    <p>We are familiar with descendant selectors, something like <code>article section</code> will allow us to style all any section so long as it has an article as an <mark>ancestor</mark>. Much of the time, this can be more than we want, but luckily we can limit the reach of the descendant chain with the use of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_selectors">Child Selector</a>. By simply changing our previous selector to <code>article &gt; section</code> we only select sections that are direct children of an article. If you're not familiar with the difference between children and descendants yet, hit the books.</p>
    <p>While not as immediately useful, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_selectors">adjacent sibling selectors</a> can be utilized to apply classes based on if elements are directly next to each other. An example would be adding a top border all but the first element of a list with <code>li + li { border-top: 1px solid #000; }</code>. If say, you wanted all the paragraphs following the first one to have an indent, but couldn't be sure that it would be only p tags, you could switch to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_selectors">general sibling selectors</a> and use a selector like <code> p ~ p { text-indent: 1em; }</code>.</p>

    <h3>With CSS</h3>
    <p>Careful use of classes can simulate boolean behavior with <abbr>CSS</abbr>, and can be used to great effect—which is why I think <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/6-current-options-css-preprocessors/"><abbr>css</abbr> preprocessors</a> (programs that write <abbr>css</abbr> for you) are somewhat unnecessary. Written way back in the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr>css</abbr> 2.0 spec: <q cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#class-html"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> gives so much power to the <q>class</q> attribute, that authors could conceivably design their own <q>document language</q> based on elements with almost no associated presentation.</q> Broken down, the rules that inform how you may apply classes are so powerful that we could introduce meta-level thinking (not you actually would, or should.)</p>

    <h3>With Javascript</h3>
    <p>Boolean Algebra, the namesake of George Boole, a 19th century mathematician who pioneered the system of logical operations, can take complicated sets of logic and break them into a fundamental binary solution that can only be one of two values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>. These <strong>Boolean values</strong> have straightforward properties, but as you combine them and use the algebraic systems, they quickly escalate in complexity.</p>

        <p>Looking at the adjacent example, notice my careful use of parentheses. In general, always use parentheses for clarity, even when you fundamentally know the order of operations. Boolean operations are more obscure when it comes to order of evaluation, performing what is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation">Short-circuit Evaluation</a>, which is a type of optimization (and quite unnecessary for most JavaScript programming).</p>
        <p>Fundamentally, without use of parentheses, the operation trys to find a true/false value as quickly as possible. Take the example and remove the parentheses and you'll see an example of this.</p>

    <h3>Coercion</h3>
    <p>While not particularly useful to a beginner programmer, type coercion is often a <em>misunderstood and misused</em> part of programming languages. In JavaScript, you have the following primitive types at your disposal: <code>number</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>boolean</code>, <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>. Trying to use any non-boolean type in a logical operation (any operation that uses a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators">logical operator</a>) may produce unexpected results as they are cast to booleans for comparison. Depending on the value they might be considered <mark class="strong">truthy</mark> or <mark class="strong">falsy</mark>. As you begin, try very hard not to rely on coercion until you understand it intuitively. In the meantime, here is a table to start getting familiar:</p>
      <table class="full">
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th>TRUTHY</th>
            <td>any <strong>non-zero</strong> number</td>
            <td>any <strong>non-empty</strong> string</td>
            <td>evaluating arrays and objects, even if empty (never do this!!)</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <th>FALSY</th>
            <td>the number <code>0</code></td>
            <td>an empty string <code>''</code></td>
            <td><code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code> and <code>NaN</code> values</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
