    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p class="intro">We have been discussing functions with more confidence every week. We know about declaring them, applying them, passing them undeclared to other functions <em>as callbacks</em>. You should be thinking about functions as nothing more than another type of variable; let’s revisit what variables are and what values they hold.</p>
    <p>Lest we forget, there are a handful of <em>types</em> that can represent a <em>value</em> in JavaScript. First are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures">primitive types</a>, such as <strong>Number</strong>, <strong>String</strong>, <strong>Boolean</strong>, <strong>Null</strong> and <strong>Undefined</strong>. Then, there is one other  non-primitive type called <strong>Object</strong>. Objects are combinations of primitive types as well as other objects, and we can make an <em>object literal</em> in a fashion such as <code>var obj = {};</code>. The <strong>Array</strong> is a type of Object as is the <strong>Function</strong>. Yes, that's right, in JavaScript we call a function a <em>callable object</em>.</p>
    <p>Some minutia notwithstanding, <strong>there are roughly 6 things you can make in JavaScript</strong>—devising interesting combinations of them; this can loosely be called <q>programming</q></p>
    <h4>Research &amp; Answer</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>Math.pow</code></dt>
      <dd>What is Math, and what is pow? Where is it declared? (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/pow">hint</a>);</dd>
      <dt><code>Math.pow(7, 2);</code></dt>
      <dd>What is happening here? What is the value? What is the <em>type</em> of the value?</dd>
      <dt><code>var ultimate_answer = 42;</code></dt>
      <dd>What is the value of our declared variable? What is it's type? (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)">of interest</a>)</dd>

    <h2>Namespaces and Scope</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Context-based style</h3>
      <p>Given two classes with the same name, can you conceive of a way to have them behave differently? In the beginning of our lightbox case-study, I discussed the method of using a parent element to control the visibility of a child element by adding a class to the parent.</p>
      <h4>A silly example</h4>
      <h4>A practical example</h4>
      <p>Remembering the first ‘W’ in <abbr title="world wide web">www</abbr> stands for world, let's recall that in the root element of our <abbr>html</abbr> document there is an attribute named <code>lang</code>. In that attribute, we specify the two character <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp">language code</a> of our document—typically <code>lang="en"</code> for english.</p>
      <p>Obviously there is a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization">internationalization</a> that must occur to adapt applications different languages and regions, but let's start with some simple (and interesting) typographic principles. In Spanish, a question is prefixed with an inverted question mark, in Greek, a question phrase is terminated with a semi-colon. In many languages, different punctuation marks are expressed differently, many countries use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillemet">Guillemets</a>, some subscripted apostrophes and many a combination thereof in reversed order. With that, let us begin a useful investigation of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">quote</a> element.</p>
      <div class="whitepaper t container">
        <aside class="note ___ float left">
          <h6>Consider a way to internationalize the quote given in the following languages. The adjacent <abbr>CSS</abbr> takes care of the default (English) version.</h6>
          <p><q lang="en">English</q></p>
          <p><q lang="fr">French</q></p>
          <p><q lang="de">German</q></p>
          <p><q lang="pl">Polish</q></p>
          <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/examples/quotes.css"/>
        </aside>
        <div class=" _______ float left">
          <pre class="prettyprint">&lt;q cite="https://goo.gl/zN7JT"&gt;Any fool can know. The point is to understand&lt;/q&gt;</pre>
          <pre class="prettyprint">
            <hr class="divider" data-before="HTML" data-after="CSS" />
            <!-- review views/css/examples/quotes.css english default -->
          </pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>Variable Scope</h3>
      <p>So we can stylistically determine how something looks (as will as linguistically add meaning) based on the heirarch and structure of our stylesheet. Likewise, we can (and should) be doing the same thing with our program code.</p>
