    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p class="intro">We have been discussing functions with more confidence every week. We know about declaring them, applying them, passing them undeclared to other functions <em>as callbacks</em>. You should be thinking about functions as nothing more than another type of variable; let’s revisit what variables are and what values they hold.</p>
    <p>Lest we forget, there are a handful of <em>types</em> that can represent a <em>value</em> in JavaScript. First are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures">primitive types</a>, such as <strong>Number</strong>, <strong>String</strong>, <strong>Boolean</strong>, <strong>Null</strong> and <strong>Undefined</strong>. Then, there is one other  non-primitive type called <strong>Object</strong>. Objects are combinations of primitive types as well as other objects, and we can make an <em>object literal</em> in a fashion such as <code>var obj = {};</code>. The <strong>Array</strong> is a type of Object as is the <strong>Function</strong>. Yes, that's right, in JavaScript we call a function a <em>callable object</em>.</p>
    <p>Some minutia notwithstanding, <strong>there are roughly 6 things you can make in JavaScript</strong>—devising interesting combinations of them; this can loosely be called <q>programming</q></p>
    <h4>Research &amp; Answer</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>Math.pow</code></dt>
      <dd>What is Math, and what is pow? Where is it declared? (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/pow">hint</a>);</dd>
      <dt><code>Math.pow(7, 2);</code></dt>
      <dd>What is happening here? What is the value? What is the <em>type</em> of the value?</dd>
      <dt><code>var ultimate_answer = 42;</code></dt>
      <dd>What is the value of our declared variable? What is it's type? (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)">of interest</a>)</dd>
