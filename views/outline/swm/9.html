    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>Last week we covered some important <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> properties fundamental to the concerns of an overlay. We wrote the entirety of a cosine function using nothing but functions and simple mathematics that we all have posessed since Junior High.</p>

    <h2>Writing &amp; Using Functions</h2>
    <p class="intro">You will learn syntax on your own despite what you may think, it's actually very simple, and any notion of being difficult is nothing more than unfamiliarity. Correctly writing programs is not about syntax, it's about abstraction—and yes, I'll admit, that is a bijillion times harder.</p>

      <h3>From First-Class to <strong>Callbacks</strong></h3>
      <p class="intro">If you've ever heard the term <em>callback</em> and thought it sounded lofty, then rejoice, if you’ve been following along, then you already know more than you think.</p>
      <div class="two columns indented">
        <p>Well known at this point is that functions are first <em>declared</em> and then <em>applied</em>. Sometimes we do the declaring, sometimes the language has defined functions for us, like <code>Math.cos();</code>. Likewise, sometimes we take charge of applying a function directly, sometimes we declare a function and never actually apply it ourselves. A function can be applied immediately, or applied later on by another function if it is passed in an uncalled state.</p>
        <p>It is the latter method that is officially known as a callback—nothing more than an undeclared function passed as a parameter to another function. You must read and understand the following notion: saying something like <strong>a function passed in an uncalled state</strong> is rather difficult, so it was wrapped into its very own word. That's right, we say <strong>callback</strong> when talking about a previously declared function being passed around in its uncalled state. Commit this to memory—from here on out, when you hear callback, you should know the precise meaning.</p>
        <p>A function given a callback determines when and how the callback is applied; this is how JavaScript does business. It is powerful and it’s this very concept that allows you to do event-based programming. If you are an interactive designer, this is a way you should start framing design problems/solutions.</p>

    <h2>Events</h2>
    <blockquote class="quote centered tt bb">
      <p>If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?</p>

      <h3>Events</h3>
      <p>In this classic thought experiment we are engaged to think about all of the events that can occur without our knowing, and then get metaphysical about whether or not the event ever occured. Clearly, this seemingly simple question has been the substance of deep philosophical thought for centuries, so I think it worth five minutes of our time. So, consider this: <q>if a mouse clicks on a webpage but a program doesn't hear it, does it make a sound?</q>.</p>
      <p>Now that we know about first-class functions and callbacks, we can actually consider events, and there are <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events">tons of events</a> that we can take advantage of.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><code>Event</code></dt>
        <dd>You can make <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Creating_and_triggering_events">custom events</a> (not very common)</dd>
        <dt><code>EventTarget</code></dt>
        <dd>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget">EventTarget</a> interface is implemented by any object that can receive events and have listeners applied to them</dd>
        <dd>Typical objects are any <abbr>HTML</abbr> <code>Element</code> or <code>window</code> object, but there are hundreds of events that can be applied to many other objects.</dd>

    <h2>Case Study: A Lightbox and JavaScript</h2>
    <p>Recalling our case study from last week, an introduction to all of the important <abbr>CSS</abbr> css for making an overlay possible was given. Surprisingly, this is the harder half of the equation in terms of steps needed to solve the problem. As we understand that process, the remaining JavaScript is quite simple, and really only requires we understand our previously outlined material. Really, our case study continues thinking about several questions.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>When does a overlay need to be opened?</li>
      <li>Is it triggered by multiple elements?</li>
      <li>If triggered by multiple events, how should we assign a listener?</li>
      <li>How do we close the lightbox?</li>
    </ol>
