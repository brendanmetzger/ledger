    <p class="intro">The most fundamental concern of an interactive designer is the ability to react to situations. Sometimes it is an existential situation like a device resolution. More often a developer chooses to create situations to interact with, and this is done through an understanding of <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> events.</p>

    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>Last week we covered some important <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> properties fundamental to the concerns of an overlay. We wrote the entirety of a cosine function using nothing but functions and simple mathematics that we all have possessed (perhaps forgotten) since Junior High.</p>
    <h4>Getting ready</h4>
    <p>Open this week’s practice <abbr>html</abbr> and <abbr>css</abbr> files, as well as the global JavaScript file. In the stylesheet, give the body <samp>20%</samp> padding on the left. Create a <samp>fixed</samp> <code class="element">nav</code> element with a width of <samp>20%</samp> and a height of <samp>100vh</samp>. Give it a <code>background-color</code>. In the <code class="element">nav</code> put a <code class="element">ul</code>, and four <code class="element">li</code> elements inside. In each <code class="element">li</code> put a <code class="element">a</code> with the text <samp>one</samp>, <samp>two</samp>, <samp>three</samp> and <samp>four</samp>. The <code>href</code> attribute should be directed to <samp>#one</samp>, <samp>#two</samp>, <samp>#three</samp> and <samp>#four</samp> respectively. Below the <code class="element">nav</code> place four <code class="element">div</code> elements each with an <code>id</code> of <samp>one</samp>, <samp>two</samp>, <samp>three</samp> and <samp>four</samp> respectively. Put some text in each element as well. In your stylesheet, set the <code class="element">div</code> elements to have a height of <samp>100vh</samp> and give each div a different background color.</p>

    <h2>Reference and Practice Material</h2>
    <p>At this point I presume it is well understood that I am really pushing functions—there is simply no way to avoid them. This week read chapter 5 on <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html">higher-order functions</a> in <cite>Eloquent JavaScript</cite> and then zoom ahead to Chapter 14 about <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/14_event.html">Handling Events</a>. If you want more practice on the basics, I encourage you to try another source. Chapter One <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch1.md">Intro to Programming</a> and Chapter Two <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/ch2.md">Intro to Javascript</a> from the series <cite>You Don’t Know Js</cite> cover the basics if you want another author’s perspective. Remember, you have access to Lynda.com and all the helpful resources there—but experience tells me that watching videos seems to have less sticking power than reading books.</p>
