    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>Last week we covered some important <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> properties fundamental to the concerns of an overlay. We wrote the entirety of a cosine function using nothing but functions and simple mathematics that we all have posessed since Junior High.</p>
    <p>Today has some heady material, so to get you sharpened for the task at hand, here is a <a href="https://gist.github.com/brendanmetzger/ae72cb1526294ea0f40a38b80b855f68">pop-quiz</a>. Grab a sheet of paper, and fill out the questions and return to me. It’s open notes, open internet, open ask a classmate. If you can’t wrap your mind around any of the questions, articulate what you don’t understand. If you can’t articulate what you don’t understand, we will have to discuss plan C.</p>

    <h2>Reference and Practice Material</h2>
    <p class="intro">Cognition and knowledge retention are difficult tasks. The new material this week has been events, but it’s no mistake that I keep revisiting functions, I will tell you every week until the end of the semester, they are the heart &amp; soul of the language, and the design pattern you must learn.</p>
    <p>Something interesting about JavaScript; the more you know it, the more profoundly simple (or insanely complex, depending on how you view simplicity) it becomes. I want you to revisit the material and the outlines I write regularly. Go further than I ask, because it will benefit you greatly. This week’s practice work is will be made much easier by material tucked away in the resources below: it’s completely up to you to find it.</p>

    <h3>Make sure you understand the following principles:</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>When do you need an event listener?</dt>
        <dd>Simply put, you need an event listener when you want to plan around something happening, but you don’t know when, where when falls anywhere from any moment to never.</dd>
        <dt>What’s up with the word <em>callback</em>?</dt>
        <dd>First, it is a regular function.</dd>
        <dd>A regular function becomes a callback when it is passed to another function as a parameter.</dd>
        <dd>The function where it has been sent to becomes responsible for executing it—that is important—you do not use the <code>()</code> operator after the function name.</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>
    <dl class="tt">
      <dt>Some topics I will not have time to work into the lecture (unless specifically asked)</dt>
      <dd>I haven’t spent much time talking about control structures (you read about them in <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html">chapter 2</a>) because I think it is easier to digest examples when you come to points in your own work when you will need to employ sech things. Everything I do will assume you understand this stuff in principle.</dd>

      <dd>Here is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for">documentation on a for loop</a></dd>

      <dd>And because it’s important to contrast, <a class="read" href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/14_event.html">Chapter 14</a> of Eloquent JavaScript covers events as well.</dd>
      <dt>Yes, more functions</dt>
