    <p class="intro">The most fundamental concern of an interactive designer is the ability to react to situations. Sometimes it is an existential situation like a device resolution. More often a developer chooses to create situations to interact with, and this is done through an understanding of <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> events.</p>

    <h3>Review</h3>
    <p>Last week we covered some important <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheets">CSS</abbr> properties fundamental to the concerns of an overlay. We wrote the entirety of a cosine function using nothing but functions and simple mathematics that we all have posessed since Junior High.</p>
    <h4>Getting ready</h4>
    <p>Open this week’s practice <abbr>html</abbr> and <abbr>css</abbr> files, as well as the global JavaScript file. In the stylesheet, give the body <samp>20%</samp> padding on the left. Create a <samp>fixed</samp> <code class="element">nav</code> element with a width of <samp>20%</samp> and a height of <samp>100vh</samp>. Give it a <code>background-color</code>. In the <code class="element">nav</code> put a <code class="element">ul</code>, and four <code class="element">li</code> elements inside. In each <code class="element">li</code> put a <code class="element">a</code> with the text <samp>one</samp>, <samp>two</samp>, <samp>three</samp> and <samp>four</samp>. The <code>href</code> attribute should be directed to <samp>#one</samp>, <samp>#two</samp>, <samp>#three</samp> and <samp>#four</samp> respectively. Below the <code class="element">nav</code> place four <code class="element">div</code> elemnts each with an <code>id</code> of <samp>one</samp>, <samp>two</samp>, <samp>three</samp> and <samp>four</samp> respectively. Put some text in each element as well. In your stylesheet, set the <code class="element">div</code> elements to have a height of <samp>100vh</samp> and give each div a different background color.</p>

    <h2>Reference and Practice Material</h2>
    <p>This week read chapter 5 on <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html">higher-order functions</a> in <cite>Eloquent JavaScript</cite>.</p>
    <p class="intro">Cognition and knowledge retention are difficult tasks. The new material this week has been events, but it’s no mistake that I keep revisiting functions, I will tell you every week until the end of the semester, they are the heart &amp; soul of the language, and the design pattern you must learn.</p>
    <p>Something interesting about JavaScript; the more you know it, the more profoundly simple (or insanely complex, depending on how you view simplicity) it becomes. I want you to revisit the material and the outlines I write regularly. Go further than I ask, because it will benefit you greatly. This week’s practice work is will be made much easier by material tucked away in the resources below: it’s completely up to you to find it.</p>

    <h3>Make sure you understand the following principles:</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>When do you need an event listener?</dt>
        <dd>Simply put, you need an event listener when you want to plan around something happening, but you don’t know when, where when falls anywhere from any moment to never.</dd>
        <dt>What’s up with the word <em>callback</em>?</dt>
        <dd>First, it is a regular function.</dd>
        <dd>A regular function becomes a callback when it is passed to another function as a parameter.</dd>
        <dd>The function where it has been sent to becomes responsible for executing it—that is important—you do not use the <code>()</code> operator after the function name.</dd>
      </dl>
    </div>
    <dl class="tt">
      <dt>Some topics I will not have time to work into the lecture (unless specifically asked)</dt>
      <dd>I haven’t spent much time talking about control structures (you read about them in <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html">chapter 2</a>) because I think it is easier to digest examples when you come to points in your own work when you will need to employ sech things. Everything I do will assume you understand this stuff in principle.</dd>
      <dd>Here is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if…else">documentation on if…else</a></dd>
      <dd>Here is <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for">documentation on a for loop</a></dd>

      <dd>And because it’s important to contrast, <a class="read" href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/14_event.html">Chapter 14</a> of Eloquent JavaScript covers events as well.</dd>
      <dt>Yes, more functions</dt>
