    <h2>Intervals and Timeouts</h2>
    <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setTimeout">Window Timers</a> are a mechanism in JavaScript that allow you to delay or repeat the application of bits of code. Conceptually, it shouldn't bend the mind too much to learn that these efforts require the use of <em>callbacks</em>, that is, functions passed to another function, with the other function determining <em>when to apply the callback</em>. We understand the motivation behind this from our experience with <strong>Event Listeners</strong>; they employ the same principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)">asynchrony</a>.</p>

        <h5>Setting a timeout.</h5>
        <p>The button below has an event listener applied, and that listener will set the timeout you see to the right. When clicked, the button will set two timeouts. The first will display an alert message in 1 second, the second will reset the html to a the initial state before the click.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> timeouts are set in milliseconds, so 1000 milliseconds is equal to 1 second.</p>

        <h5>Setting an interval.</h5>
        <p>The most obvious analogy one can draw to an interval is a clock. So obvious in fact, that we get lost in the nature of what an <em>intervals</em> explain concepts in mathematics, music, and cartesian space. They give means to understand phenomena that occurs on a continuum through finite analysis, and any explanation of color, time and distance cannot avoid such analysis.</p>
        <p id="color" class="notate">The script adjacent employs an interval combined with a transition in css. Recall our modulus operator can explain an interval. The <abbr title="Cascading Stylesheet">CSS</abbr> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value">hsl color</a> property describes color value along a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV">cylindrical coordinate</a>. Circles, loops, timers, color: <strong>they can all be merged conceptually as intervals.</strong></p>

        <h5>Clearing timeouts and intervals.</h5>
        <p>When applying a <code>setTimeout</code> or <code>setInterval</code>, you must be concerned with one other facet, and that is how to stop them. Using the <em>focus</em> and <em>blur</em> events of the <code>textarea</code> below you can see a simple typewrite effect in action. When calling setTimeout, it will return an integer representing the timeou ID. You can pass that id to a function called <code>clearTimeout</code> and it will cancel your callback from executing.</p>

        <p>You may notice some new stuff: I introduce some string functions that let you slice apart a string, as well as a cryptic looking <em>regular expression</em> that I use to give an extra pause whenever the last word typed is capitalized or a non-word character. Simple tricks like this can be used to give programs <q>human</q> feel.</p>
