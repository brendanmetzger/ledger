      <p>From my café perch I am watching people on the move—pedestrians, drivers, cyclists—with gazes fixed, eyes cast downward on a small illuminated slab. Though their minds ought to be focused on the primary endeavor, it’s not as pressing as ‘liking’ picture from an acquaintance or friend. As this addiction grows, I find it harder to see the benefit of such behavior. It’s obvious at this point, that it isn’t <em>those people</em> that do it, it is <em>all of us</em>.</p>
      <p>As someone who teaches interactive design and programming, I appreciate the internet as a medium, and the computer as a tool. I studied computer science early in my student career, and even after switching to an art and design curriculum I have made an effort to take a large dose of mathematics courses. Hanging around both the art and the science camps leaves me feeling qualified to propose the following opinion. Those focused on purely technical matters largely consider <q>how</q> to be the operative start to an inquiry—an inquiry focusing on outcomes. Those focused in the arts, consider <q>why</q> as the operative, and look for value and authenticity. For the record, I prefer the <q>why</q> camp though my career has required a fairly technical aptitude in dealing with the <q>how</q> of things.</p>
      <p>Looking in the past, you see large chunks of time where the artists and craftspeople were those with the keenest mind for science and math, from anatomy to architecture without sacrificing their role as guardians of value and authenticity. I have observed a great bifurcation of the learning outcomes that have divorced doing from considering, and engineering learning to be mostly problem solving. The smartest people in the world are no longer in academia, but corporations, where they likely spend much less time discussing if a problem deserves to be solved and who,if anyone beyond their institution, truly benefits from their solutions. We have said artists do not need science and scientists do not need art. We have turned a game of chess into a game of rock-lifting.</p>
      <p>It is frequent anymore to observe the majority of students examining their phones regularly, distancing themselves from the words coming out of my mouth. Words that I speak to help them create things and better understand this medium, but alas, words they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_multitasking">can’t and won’t hear</a>. The content of these glowing screens is usually provided by a platform designed to connect and share, or if you look at the money, to distract and sell things to them. A stream of sometimes important, sometimes trivial, often repetitive tidbits, available constantly, and demanding their <em>immediate attention</em>.</p>
      <p>I understand the extreme draw of that familiar vibration—the feeling that <em>it must be checked</em>. I ask myself why I’m drawn to this and if I am better for it, but the part that fills me with melancholy is that this distraction is not coincidental or natural—not remotely. Ask the best of us to design products that really do waste our time and distract us to the point of losing respect for one another, and I’m not convinced if you’ll answer the <q>why</q> of it so eloquently.</p>
      <h3 class="pullquote centered ruled bottom top pad" style="font-family:Baskerville;margin:1em 0;">Perfect is the enemy of good</h3>
      <p> If today you can remove yourself from the real life around you for a few seconds every few minutes, what will a perfect social network do for us? I think if we asked <q>why</q> a little bit more we might actually do things in life that don’t disconnect us from each other when we are actually very much in the same place, looking at the same things and share a willingness to talk about them.</p>
