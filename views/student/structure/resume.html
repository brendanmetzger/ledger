      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>I would like to become a professional crane operator. To meet my objective, I have studied crane maneuvers and read all of the pertinent crane operation literature. Operating a crane is not only crucial in the building of large structures, but it is highly impressive when you meeting a new person and they want to know what you do for a living.</p>
