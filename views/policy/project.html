  <summary><h3>Project</h3></summary>
  <p><strong>Quick to start, slow to finish</strong> has been said to be the battle-cry of the procrastinator, but we're going to employ that idea to our advantage. The project is a semester-long effort; it should reflect some interest of yours and you should be ambitious about what you plan on achieving. Often one of the lengthier tasks when working on a major project is coming up with the idea, so given more time and plenty of expectation, hopefully we eliminate some of that anixety. Contribute work and ideas to your project frequently and be prepared for random check-ins.</p>
  <h5 class="strong t">Grading</h5>
  <p>All projects are evaluated based on a range from 1 or <q>perfection</q> to 0 or <q>no submission</q>. I've designed the criterion to ensure that perfection—and this is important to me—is essentially impossible (and not a relevant goal in my opinion). Thus, your score will fall between <code>[0,1]</code> and is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grading_on_a_curve">curved</a> to give a percentage and corresponding letter. To fairly assess all projects,  I scored your work on a variety of criterion; effort, aesthetic, presentation, research, concept, etc. Given a diverse group of students and interests, this insures that any above average effort you made was rewarded and likewise, simple expectations (did you present, source code organized, you had a concept, etc) would affect your average negatively.</p>
