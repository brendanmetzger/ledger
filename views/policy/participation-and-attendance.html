  <summary><h3>Participation and Attendance</h3></summary>
  <p><strong>Absences affect your grade.</strong> Missing class not only leads to missing discussions and an inability to help your peers, but also it means you are very likely to fall irreversably behind. Circumstances come up where we cannot attend, and as I believe we are all honest until proven otherwise, so I consider all absences validâ€”no need to explain yourself. I would consider it a courtesy to tell me you will not make it to class, but it is is crucial that you understand the following policy.</p>
  <h5 class="strong t">Grading</h5>
  <p><span class="important">As a matter of bookeeping, you will be marked absent whenever you are not in attendance</span>. Your grade will reflect that absence, which can be redeemed by planning a presentation with me on some topic surrounding web development. You must present to the class no later than two weeks after missing class.</p>
  <p>Beyond presence, participation is of course, showing up and paying attention, but also may include in-class work, pop-quizzes, etc. Courtesy and attention to your peers is paramount. If you have a habit of logging in to your computer and zoning out to YouTube or Facebook whenever activity is happening in class, that doesn't just affect your grade, such <strong>behavior affects your reputation</strong> and is a pet peeve of mine.</p>
