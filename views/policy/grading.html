    <p>My grading policy might evolve depending on what works best and keeps us happy. Many students find grades to be a motivating force. Likewise, many do not. Before I dive into the nuts and bolts, I want to stress that grades are an unfortunate circumstance that our education system requires to matriculate. That’s not a bad thing, but it’s really hard to administrate in a way that makes us feel like we tried and we did Ok.</p>
    <p>We're all taught about bell curves, though we be have some bias that thwarts our understanding of mathematical averages. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/68-95-99.7_rule">Emperically</a>, 68% of of samples cluster around the mean. That leaves the probability at 32% of being above or below average. Thus begins the difficulty of deciding what letter grade means average, and what meaning each letter conveys. From reading the Academic Handbook and Reviewing Syllabi, our grades are assigned and represented as given in the following table.</p>
    <!-- insert views/policy/table/letter-grades.html -->
    <p>My best interpretation of this is as follows. There are ten possible letter outcomes, and assuming they have equal probability of occurring, the median is the mean, ie., <q>average</q> is a C+, and according to our table, average falls within the realm of <q>Good</q>. Whether or not this is accurate, I like it, I think it’s acceptable, and I expect it from students.</p>
    <p>The part that has got out of line is that we now consider a C to be <em>not very good</em> when really it is well within the guidelines of average. Consider the crux where it is a bad thing to call something average, when average is nothing more than a mathematical formula;  68% should be somewhere in the B to C spectrum.</p>
    <p>Why bring all this up? Because there is a valuable lesson here that transcends grading. The table, the grading, the entire concept is engineered toward the notion of excellency and we all want it. The byproduct is designing a class for people to do well rather that risk average or below average marks. This is a horrible outcome for you, the student.</p>
    <p>It is not that I feel exceptional students are robbed of exceptional grades—gaining superior knowledge can be rewarded outside of school. High marks on your transcript are really more important for continuation in higer ed, and taking away that opportunity makes administering grades hard. Difficult as that is, a far more depressing outcome, is the feeling that nobody knows as much as they could have because it introduced too much risk for the <abbr title="Grade point average">GPA</abbr>.</p>
    <p>Harder material is harder to learn, there is no way around it. And while I want you to get high marks, I don’t want you to take the easy way in life because of fear of failure, or worse, fear of not getting a congratulations. This class is challenging and I will challenge you. If you want an above average mark, <strong>simply accept the challenge</strong> and I guarantee that things will work out in your favor.</p>
