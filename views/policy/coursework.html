  <h2>Coursework</h2>
  <p>Coursework will consist of the following components, though pop-quizzes, extra-credit, challenges may be thrown in when necessary. Mandatory attendance is expected and all abscences marked regardless of excused or not. <sup>*</sup>In the spirit of equity, should you have a valid reason for an abscence, then you can do make up work, but that work obviously requires <b>presence</b>. </p>

      <td>Practic Assignments will be fairl straight forward. I will compose them to offer a guided opportunity to practice. They may be challenging at points, but that is a good thing: see <i>participation</i></td>
      <td>Projects are personal, and ambition, creativity and effort are extremely important.</td>
      <td>Quizzes will be low-stress (hopefully) and no cramming necessary. Simply, an opportunity to show you <em>are up to date with the assigned readings</em>. They will be difficult, a mix of fill-in-the-blank, short-answer, and multiple choice. They will be graded on a curve so due-dilegence will be rewarded.</td>
      <td>Participation is obviously showing up and paying attention, submitting the in-class work, etc., but, some of this is difficult to measure, so you will need to <a href="#">ask questions</a> via the question mechanism. You will lose <b>-10% per abscense</b>, up to <b>one</b> absence can be made up<sup>*</sup>.</td>
