  <h2>Coursework</h2>
  <p>Coursework will consist of the following components, though pop-quizzes, extra-credit, challenges may be thrown in when necessary. <strong>Mandatory attendance</strong> is expected and all absences marked regardless of excused or not. Make sure that point explicitly clear: I can and usually will be lenient on practice work, quizzes, and to a lesser degree, projects. In the spirit of equity, should you have a valid reason for an absence, then you can do make up work, but that work obviously requires <b>presence<sup>*</sup></b>, which will mean extra work in the form of a presentation that you propose to myself and the class. Requesting this must be timely, no later than one week from the time you missed.</p>
  <p class="focus warn"><strong>This institution take absence seriously.</strong> As such, an absence is non-negotiable: missing class unavoidably affects your grade. If you absolutely must miss, then I may work with you to lessen the pain based on the circumstances. Thatâ€™s a one-time only deal.</p>

        <td>Studies are designed to get you work on specific technical skills while focusing on a design outcome. The skills gained and efforts made in studies should make their way immediately into semester-long project.</td>
        <td><strong>Quick to start, slow to finish</strong>. The project is a semester-long effort; it should reflect some interest of yours and you should be ambitious about what you plan on achieving. Plan to work on projects every week throughout the semester.</td>
        <td>Quizzes will be low-stress (hopefully) and no cramming necessary. Simply, an opportunity to show you <em>are up to date with the assigned readings</em>. The first quiz will be a mix of fill-in-the-blank, short-answer, and multiple choice. The second will be an in-class essay where you will reflect on the class and address a topic given that day.</td>
        <td>Participation is obviously showing up and paying attention, but also may include in-class work, pop-quizzes, etc. Courtesy and attention to your peers is paramount. <strong>If you have a habit of logging in to your computer and zoning out, you and I will be chatting frequently to address that!</strong></td>
