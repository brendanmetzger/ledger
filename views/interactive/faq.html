  <dt>Can I use jQuery?</dt>
  <dd>Yes and no. You may ultimately use whatever shortcuts you desire, but my grading of shortcuts will not be very desirable. The goal of this course is to build confidence, so that once you are beyond the fundamentals of Scripting for Web and Mobile I and II, you can use frameworks confidently and effectively.</dd>
