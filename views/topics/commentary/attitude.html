    <p>There is a lot of material to cover in this course, and though it is not rocket science, it may be burdensome at times. In fact, I sympathize with you—it is quite difficult to organize all the material we cover and keep track of everything we are supposed to learn. You may be running on empty by the end of the semester, but, come that time I hope this is the class you learned a lot and stressed very little.</p>
    <p>Now while there will be many things I ask you to learn, the first obstacle you will face is learning to learn for its own sake, which entails going beyond what I ask. One may be of the opinion that this is a matter of personal work-ethic, but it is really a matter of <strong>time management</strong>—though perhaps some inherently have time-management skills and some do not. Alas, there is a principle known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_syndrome">student syndrome</a> that essentially theorizes procrastination as a predictable psychological behavior that students engage in. To nutshell it for you (and this is validated in my experience as a teacher), no matter how long I give to work on an assignment, most will make a first attempt on the day before it is due, or even the following night before it is due<sup>*</sup>. As Isaac Asimov once put it, <q cite="">In ten hours a day you have time to fall twice as far behind your commitments as in five hours a day.</q></p>
    <p>I will not condone, nor allow this behavior—not because I want to increase your stress, but because its crucial to me that I <em>decrease</em> stress in this course. Learning well is a series of useful habits, that both make you successful as a student and feel good as a human, and I'm going to push these principles throughout this course.</p>

    <p><q>Creativity always comes as a surprise to us; therefore we can never count on it and we dare not believe in it until it has happened. In other words, we would not consciously engage upon tasks whose success clearly requires that creativity be forthcoming. <mark>Hence, the only way in which we can bring our creative resources fully into play is by misjudging the nature of the task, by presenting it to ourselves as more routine, simple, undemanding of genuine creativity than it will turn out to be.</mark></q></p>

  <p class="intro">Stress is not always bad—were we not to underestimate the nature of a task, we would likely avoid strenuous activity. Difficulty in finishing tasks make us stronger mentally and physically, so learning how to accept and manage stressors is a skill one must acquire to excel—especially in a creative field.</p>

    <p><q>Stanton (2006) found that high stress levels negatively impacted on the health and well-being of
the individual. Individuals experiencing high levels of stress suffer psychological symptoms such
as job dissatisfaction, low self esteem, reduced motivation, anxiety, depression and decreased
organizational commitment (Kaluzniacky, 1998; Sun &amp; Doong, 1999). <mark>These symptoms inhibit
the affected individual from learning and developing new skills and knowledge.</mark></q></p>
