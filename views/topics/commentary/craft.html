    <p>The simplest things in life are those with the attribute of <q>computability</q>—meaning there is a mechanical process for determining an answer if necessary. Is this an odd number? Will this conduct electricity? Will these pants fit? The opposite is an existential proposition; ask <em>is life meaningful</em> and you will never find a universal truth. You probably will not even find a consistent answer day to day.</p>
    <p>My parents are somewhat eccentric folk and it could be argued that they would benefit from some rigor when it comes to business-thinking (though the apple does not fall all that far from the tree). My father was a carpenter, and candidly, has not been a disciple of pragmatic solutions. However, this did not make him a miserable carpenter; I’m of the belief that it most likely prevented it.</p>
    <p>Technique matters a great deal, as the carefully studied methods of an apprentice can lead to a mastery of a craft. Thought, beauty and integrity matter equally, but unlike technique, they are not easily defined nor mastered. As someone who appreciates these things, it is important to me that they do not become antiquities. When one goes about their work both without honing skills nor seeking perspective then the work truly is worth nothing.</p>
    <p>Somewhere along the path of our pedagogical approaches we have flipped things around. We tend to avoid the easy mechanical truths of science and math (and with it the precise execution of craft). Instead, we talk a bunch, copy even more, and avoid anything that seems a bit too difficults. As Noam Chompsky once said, <q>The world is a very puzzling place. If you’re not willing to be puzzled, you just become a replica of someone else’s mind.</q> The easiest problems are the ones in life with answers—do not avoid them by convincing yourself they are too hard.</p>
