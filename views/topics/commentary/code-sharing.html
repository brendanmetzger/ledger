    <h2>Some Thoughts on Code Sharing</h2>
    <p class="intro">There is lots of fascinating interactive work available to learn from. Github is a place many developers store and share their code, and you can even see a <a href="https://github.com/showcases">curated showcase</a> of interesting libraries and projects meant for hacking. I will temper that excitement for a moment to remind that there is no substitution for understanding and designing your own solutions—social networks (yes github has ♥︎'s and followers) often devolve to echo chambers.</p>

    <p>I am always reevaluating what should and should not be presented to folks starting ot to learn so many new concepts in the web development domain, and typically it centers around, <q>does this lead to good habits?</q> That means I leave some good techniques and optimizations (and some easy ones) out on the curb. Optimizations are largely meaningless—like a mega-light racing bicycle—if you are not in excellent shape already.</p>
    <p>For this reason, it is challenging to preach fundamentals when libraries like jQuery do lots of optimizing for the user even if you only want a handful shortcuts—you buy the whole package—and that is <em>not</em> efficient. In design there are always downsides to efficiency, and as any physicist explaining the laws of conservation of energy will tell you, <q>there is no such thing as free lunch!</q></p>
    <h3 class="tt b">An Example of Optimization</h3>
    <p><img src="[$cdn/images/transaxle.png]" style="mix-blend-mode: multiply;shape-margin:1em;shape-outside:polygon(0 0, 10% 50%, 0 50%, 0 70%, 50% 100%, 100% 100%, 90% 0)" class="____ float right"/>I harp on the importance of using <code>addEventListener('load', <i>callback</i>)</code> in your script if you are going to query or modify the <abbr>dom</abbr>. In the jQuery framework, the authors <a href="http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/#launching-code-on-document-ready">say something</a> similar, albeit by glossing over several details and just insisting that you use their technique. My beef is twofold: first, they employ sloppy JavaScript to point out the ‘native’ weakness which seems intentional given that jQuery is written by very smart people. Second, they negatively critique the <code>load</code> event as dangerous without feeling compelled to tell you how they have improved it, so allow me. They use a different event: <code>addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', <i>callback</i>)</code>, a modest enhancement that do a better job if you have a sloppy page to begin with (I'll spare the rant there).</p>
    <h3 class="tt b">Polyfills and Compatability</h3>
    <p>The <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event does not work in all versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer—specifically version 8 and below (a tiny market share). A small enough marketshare that I would mostly rule it out, or if I cannot do that I will settle on a regression and just use the <code>load</code> event in IE (and this is pretty easy). Before we get too uptight about going backwards, note, 0.4% (or, 0.004 in decimal) represents <abbr>IE</abbr> 8 (and below) <em>globally</em>; a statistic that dwarfs actual accessibility concerns.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, to a novice that solution may not present itself due to experience, but just as often a professional avoids that route because it is not an <em>optimization</em>, it is <em>a regression</em>. For those unwilling to regress, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyfill">polyfill</a> is created to make sure they can climb the mountain no matter what is in their way, and this a a design philosophy I am generally opposed to. A philosophy I am in favor of is understanding decisions, so I began to set about learning how to fix the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> <abbr title="situation normal: all f'd up">snafu</abbr>.</p>
      <p>I googled to find <a href="https://gist.github.com/ShirtlessKirk/06e55abf19d527fe736d">this polyfill</a>, read it over, and found it difficult to understand, even downright confusing. I will help you see what I see, and hope that intuitively grasp that it takes patience to read such prose and not getting it does not mean you are bad at anything. Basically all I understand about this code is the syntax, most of the technique and application is the programming equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_English">legalese</a> to me. Here is the part I can see though when picking it apart: at line 172~173 the author is allowing for the callback I am most interested in to be executed twice (but doesn't really know and even admits that in the adjacent comment). From experience this is not ideal, but testing it would be almost impossible—because if it is a bug there is only a .004 chance that anyone will ever see it, and of that 0.004 that could, there is fraction of that percent that anyone would even notice.</p>
    <p>This is 400 lines of code and I'm telling you that a regression, or in our metaphor, by choosing to walk <em>around</em> the mountain, it could be reliably solved in 1/10 as many keystrokes. Yes, someone struggled really hard to climb the mountain, but in this instance, what may have happened (metaphorically) is that they ran out of energy, tripped over a rock, knocked themselves unconscious and dreamed that they actually climbed to the top. Remember that when you cut and paste, if you did not write it or read the substance of your clipboard, it is actually your mistake.</p>
