    <h2>Introduction to <code>new</code></h2>
    <p>In JavaScript, <em>new</em> is a strange bird. You've seen it in the <code>Date</code> and <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> objects, and in fact, there are several more objects that require it’s usage. I’ll introduce this concept slowly over the remaining part of the semester via examples because there is a growing school of thought that will make the argument that it could (should?) be abolished from the language completely. The reasoning is legitimate, albeit abstruse, but to be honest, there are moments I like what <code>new</code> allows you to accomplish.</p>
    <p>Essentially, <code>new</code> is an operator, like a <code>+</code> or a <code>%</code> sign. Those coming from Object Oriented languages (myself included) think of new as something you just do, as in <q>I’m gonna make a <span style="text-decoration:underline">new</span> object</q>. However, JavaScript is not like this—functions <em>are already objects you can use and manipulate immediately</em>. This is because in JS there are no such things as <em>classes</em>, likewise, no such thing as instantiation.</p>
    <p>So, step one is to introduce the notion of the new operator as a verb instead of a adjective. In contrast to our <abbr title="object oriented">oo</abbr> approach earlier, we would say something akin to this JS: <q>I’m gonna <span style="text-decoration:underline">new</span> this function</q>. From there, what happens is you call the function like normal, but now the function is made aware if a magical variable called <code>this</code>, and by default, it gives you back that variable without asking for it.</p>

      <p>This code illustrates the most basic point I want you to begin to see taking place, and that is using <code>new</code> changes what an object <strong>returns</strong> and what it considers <strong>this</strong> to mean.</p>
      <p>Co into your console, and execute <code>callTwoWays()</code> and inspect the output present. Why is the first message <code>undefined</code>? Notice that the second message after you <em>new</em>'d the function is quite different, especially regarding to the argument given.</p>
