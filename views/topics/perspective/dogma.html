  <h1>youâ€™re doing it wrong</h1>
  <p>Many articles about programming, especially coming from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_evangelist">evangelist</a> community, tend to follow the same formula. They start with some premise of when everything was lame, moving on to when they realized how great whatever language or program they are writing about took ahold of them.
