  <h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
  <p class="intro">This is both the easiest thing to learn, also the easiest to skip, so it is worth revisiting often. As you get more familiar with writing source code, your efforts transcend from <q>getting it to work</q> into <q>getting it to work in a way someone else can understand</q>.</p>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)">Naming Conventions</a> are a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for identifiers, be it classes, IDs or variables and functions in JavaScript. In <abbr title="hypertext markup language">html</abbr> distinguishing between upper and lowercase is not extremely important for correct page rendering, but tag names should be in lowercase. In <abbr title="cascading stylesheets">css</abbr> and JavaScript, upper and lowercase words are entirely different. Likewise, whitespace is another obstacle—<abbr title="cascading stylesheets">css</abbr> classes and IDs as well as JavaScript variables cannot start with a number, and cannot contain any whitespace. In many ways, learning to program is simply learning to become <strong>extremely</strong> careful about naming things and typing those names.</p>
    <p>This is something you generally learn over time, but standard cleverness/carefulness applies now. You can prefix and suffix IDs with common words to keep them unique but class-like. You can develop some taxonomy for <abbr title="cascading stylesheets">css</abbr> for common usage. In JavaScript—and really all programming—developers take this to another level. Not only is important to be consistent in your own work, there are many agreed upon conventions and techniques. Browse these <a href="http://www.j-io.org/Javascript-Naming_Conventions">JavaScript conventions</a> and try to begin implementing some of the techniques.</p>

      <p class="pad">While not particularly noteworthy, consistency is something that takes a lot of practice and effort. Try to keep your variable names, class names and any other name in a fashion where you (and others!) can make sense of what your code is doing.</p>

      <h3 class="t">Snake case is <code>low_like_a_snake</code></h3>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case">Snake case</a> is a way of having multi-word strings by replacing white space with an underscore. In CSS, it’s common to use a hyphen (-) as well.</p>
      <h3 class="tt">Camel Cased is <code>bumpyLikeAcamel</code></h3>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase">Camel Case</a> is when you separate multi-word strings by replacing white space with the adjoining word converted to uppercase.</p>

    <h3>Namespace and Scope</h3>
    <p>As programs grow, it becomes harder (and it is generally unwise) to add more and more complicated variable and class names. To combat this obvious setback, a highly organized individual will employ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace">namespacing</a> techniques. One way think of namespacing is imagining that every car in America had an federal license plate instead of by state. Think about what that would do; only one person would be able to register a plate with <span class="code">POOPS</span>. Namespaced to each individual state, and all of a sudden each state can have the full spectrum of options. Now imagine each county had their own plate, and so on and so forth.</p>
    <p>Just like adding folders to your computer, this organization principle is essentially namespacing. With <abbr title="cascading style sheets">CSS</abbr>, this can be accomplished with classes, i.e., <code>.outer .inner</code> would only apply inner if a parent has an outer, thus giving <code>.inner</code> different meanings depending on context. In JavaScript, this is accomplished with objects, i.e., <code>var bob = { age: '...'}</code>, or through clever uses of functions and scope. Say you have two object variables, <code>bob</code> and <code>sally</code>, each representing the same <em>type</em> of object; <code>bob.age</code> and <code>sally.age</code> have namespaced the age property.</p>
