  <h2>Demo: <em>an article</em></h2>
  <p>Something that is suitable for todayâ€™s material would be an article. Like the templates offered when you start up a word processing program, today we are going to outline text into a both <em>meaningful</em> as well as <em>compelling</em> composition. Articulating our message is the most fundamental part of being a communicator. To show you the type of work I want you to engage in <mark>I've started a <a href="/outline/resources/article.txt">document</a> that we can work on together.</mark> Implementing more structure around content is always the first step and good habits there lead to good outcomes in the next steps to come.</p>
  <h4 class="tt">Some extra things to try</h4>
  <ul class="stylized star t">
    <li>add multiple classes to one element</li>
    <li>use a type selector with a class</li>
    <li>use descendant selectors (class and type)</li>
    <li>use types, classes, and descendent selectors all together</li>
  </ul>
