    <p>Use HTML text content elements to organize blocks or sections of content placed between the opening and closing <code class="element">body</code> tags. Anytime you are tempted to use a generic <code class="element">div</code> consult this list first to see if there is a suitable replacement.

      <td>The <strong>HTML <code>div</code> element</strong> (or <em>HTML Document Division Element</em>) is the generic container for flow content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the <strong>class</strong> or <strong>id</strong> attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as <strong>lang</strong>. It should be used only when no other semantic element (such as <a href="#the-article-element"><code>article</code></a> or <a href="#the-nav-element"><code>nav</code></a>) is appropriate.</td>

It is usually followed by a <a href="#the-dd-element"><code>dd</code></a> element; however, multiple <code>dt</code> elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next <a href="#the-dd-element"><code>dd</code></a> element.</td>

While it is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the main flow. Usually this is an image, an illustration, a diagram, a code snippet, or a schema that is referenced in the main text, but that can be moved to another page or to an appendix without affecting the main flow.</td>

Typically, unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, like a dot, a circle or a squared. The bullet style is not defined in the HTML description of the page, but in its associated CSS, using the <dfn>list-style-type</dfn> property.</td>
