    <h3>Multimedia, Embedded and Scripted Content</h3>
    <p>This content can often be described as extraneous to the page it is embedded in—or said more plainly, the content often lives in a different file or a different format than standard <abbr>html</abbr>. Images are probably the most notable, but this includes other media (audio/video) as well as media generated by programs—such as JavaScript and the <code>canvas</code> element.</p>

      <th><code>area</code></th>
      <td>The <code>area</code> element defines a hot-spot region on an image, and optionally associates it with a hypertext link. This element is used only within a <code>map</code> element.</td>

    <tr id="the-audio-element" data-priority="2">
      <th><code>audio</code></th>
      <td>The <code>audio</code> element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain one or more audio sources, represented using the <code>src</code> attribute or the <code>source</code> element; the browser will choose the most suitable one.</td>

      <th><code>img</code></th>
      <td>An <code>img</code> element represents an image and its fallback content. The image is specified in the <code>src</code> attribute. The value of the <code>alt</code> attribute and the content referred to by the <code>longdesc</code> attribute are the <code>img</code> element’s fallback content and provide equivalent content for users that cannot or will not process images.</td>

      <th><code>track</code></th>
      <td>The <code>track</code> element is used as a child of the media elements—<code>audio</code> and <code>video</code>. It lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automatically handle subtitles. The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (<samp>.vtt</samp> files) — Web Video Text Tracks.</td>
