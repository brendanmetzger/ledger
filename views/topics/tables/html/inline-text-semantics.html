    <h3>Text Level Semantics</h3>
    <p>Use the HTML <dfn>inline</dfn> text semantic to define the meaning, structure, or style of a word, line, or any arbitrary piece of text. Here is the full <a href="https://w3c.github.io/html/textlevel-semantics.html#textlevel-semantics">whitepaper</a> for review.</p>

Another example of its use is to mark the lead sentence of each paragraph of an article.</td>
