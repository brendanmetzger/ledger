    <h2>Anatomy of the cascading stylesheet language</h2>
    <p>There are essentially two things that make a stylesheet work, the first is the <strong>selector</strong>, and once the selector has found its target, you can begin modify the targets <strong>properties</strong>. Become familiar with those two terms, I will say <strong>selector</strong> and <strong>property</strong> with some frequency. Selector means <q>find this node</q> and properties means <q>adjust the way this thing looks</q>.</p>
    <h3 class="tt">Selectors</h3>
    <p>Selectors are the handles that target specific <abbr title="Hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr> Element Nodes. Specific means anything from one element such as <code>#special { …props</code> to literally every element, with something like <code>* { …props</code>. Selectors can be concatenated with a comma to apply one set of property settings to several selectors—concatenating the previous examples would look like so: <code>#special, * { …props</code>. Selectors are a heady topic, and one that we will be spending easily the next five weeks on.</p>
    <h3>Properties</h3>
    <p>Properties are simply the things we can adjust—these are truly the styles in stylesheet. For starters, here is an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">exhaustive reference</a>. Notice that once you have targeted an element with a selector, you can control many many properties that affect its presentation and even a few that affect behavior.</p>
    <h3>Syntax</h3>
    <p>Stylesheet languages, like Markup Languages, are quite forgiving, which is actually a bigger headache than if they were less-so. A typo in these languages are typically ignored which leads to a misunderstanding, so try your best to be organized, and as always, have the console open (every year tools get better at helping point out your mistakes). Glancing at an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Syntax">overview of the syntax</a>, the declaration of a <abbr>CSS</abbr> ruleset resembles a programming data structure to some degree. Curly braces, colons, semicolons and careful use of punctuation operators is the starting point. From the onset, organization and code conventions are not only important, but mandatory for this course.</p>
