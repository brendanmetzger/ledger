    <h2>Anatomy of the cascading stylesheet language</h2>
    <p>There are essentially two things that make a stylesheet work, the first is the <strong>selector</strong>, and once the selector has found its target, you can begin modify the targets <strong>properties</strong>. Become familiar with those two terms, I will say <strong>selector</strong> and <strong>property</strong> with some frequency. Selector means <q>find this node</q> and properties means <q>adjust the way this thing looks</q>.</p>
    <h3 class="tt">Selectors</h3>
    <p>Selectors are the handles that target specific <abbr title="Hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr> Element Nodes. Specific means anything from one element such as <code>#special { …props</code> to literally every element, with something like <code>* { …props</code>. Selectors can be concatenated with a comma to apply one set of property settings to several selectors—concatenating the previous examples would look like so: <code>#special, * { …props</code>. Selectors are a heady topic, and one that we will be spending easily the next five weeks on.</p>
      <h3>Blocks</h3>
      <p>A block, as far as stylesheets are concerned, is a group of properties. In fact, its worth getting comfortable with seeing { curly braces } all over the place, and recognizing that you never, ever, (ever) see a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter">bracket delimiter</a> all by itself. If it was opened, it must be closed. One ore more selectors are followed by a block, which represents how the selected elements will be styled.</p>
    <h3>Properties and values</h3>
    <p>Properties are simply the things we can adjust—these are truly the styles in stylesheet. For starters, here is an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">exhaustive reference</a>. Notice that once you have targeted an element with a selector, you can control many many properties within the block that affect its presentation and even a few that affect behavior.</p>
    <h3>Syntactic Concerns</h3>
    <p>Stylesheet languages, like Markup Languages, are declarative: you say what you want to happen, and some other program determines how that happens. Declarative languages can be quite forgiving, which is mostly a good thing. Good in that you talk about what you want to do, not how it is to be done. They are flexible, and generally if the parser does not understand an instruction, it simply skips it. Here is where we get a taste of the bad; a genuine f-up in a declarative language can lead to confusion if let fester. Try your best to be organized, and as always, have the console open (every year tools get better at helping point out your mistakes). Glancing at an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Syntax">overview of the syntax</a>, the declaration of a <abbr>CSS</abbr> ruleset resembles—at least typographically—a programming data structure. Curly braces, colons, semicolons and careful use of punctuation operators is the starting point.</p>
