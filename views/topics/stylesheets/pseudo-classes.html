      <p>A class is added to an element to apply a style. In theory, a developer could create a perfect stylesheet with well defined classes, and then apply those classes to <abbr>HTML</abbr> later on, as necessary. With practice, you often write a stylesheet to set a baseline for yourself that fits a pattern of your development techniques, such as reseting the font size and margin of certain elements before you write any markup whatsoever. It is wise to consider what sort of classes you should always have on hand (like <code>.container</code> I mentioned in our intro to floats) that facilitate certain patterns you are sure to encounter on every project. On that note, let us consider some patterns.</p>
      <p><a href="http://codepen.io/brendanmetzger/pen/GjdJdy?editors=1100#0">For example</a>, say we are developing a typographic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_guide">style guide</a>, and we would like the first paragraph of every article to be 150% larger than the following paragraphs. Even though our style guide is only conceptual at this point, we know that we should be thinking about how to deal with first paragraphs. We could make a class for that—say <code>.enlarge</code> that we apply to a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and that would work well for most purposes.</p>
      <p>While that is a decent solution, and the generic nature of <code>.enlarge</code> is admirable, we didn’t really address our problem as well as we could, and we are reliant on actually writing <abbr>html</abbr> to apply that class. At this point, we may notice the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_quantification">existential state</a> that <em>if there is at least one paragraph</em> in an article, then <em>some</em> paragraph must be the first. Does this present us with an opportunity? The answer is yes, indeed there is an opportunity, and we can use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes">pseudo classes</a>.</p>
      <p>The adjacent list notes many of the pseudo classes available. Some like <code>:hover</code> are hopefully quite familiar. Some like <code>:focus</code> and <code>:enabled</code> are only for form elements, which is more advanced fodder. My advice is to become friendly with the ordering pseudos, which are those containing <strong>first</strong>, <strong>last</strong> and <strong>nth</strong>.</p>

    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:link" title="The :link CSS pseudo-class lets you select links inside elements. This will select any link which has not yet been visited, even those already styled using selector with other link-related pseudo-classes like :hover, :active or :visited. In order to appropriately style links, you need to put the :link rule before the other ones, as defined by the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active. The :focus pseudo-class is usually placed right before or right after :hover, depending on the expected effect."><code>:link</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:visited" title="The :visited CSS pseudo-class lets you select only links that have been visited. This style may be overridden by any other link-related pseudo-classes, that is :link, :hover, and :active, appearing in subsequent rules. In order to style appropriately links, you need to put the :visited rule after the :link rule but before the other ones, defined in the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active."><code>:visited</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:active" title="The :active CSS pseudo-class matches when an element is being activated by the user. It allows the page to give a feedback that the activation has been detected by the browser. When interacting with a mouse, this is typically the time between the user presses the mouse button and releases it. The :active pseudo-class is also typically matched when using the keyboard tab key. It is frequently used on &lt;a&gt; and &lt;button&gt; HTML elements, but may not be limited to just those."><code>:active</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover" title="The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user designates an element with a pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. This style may be overridden by any other link-related pseudo-classes, that is :link, :visited, and :active, appearing in subsequent rules. In order to style appropriately links, you need to put the :hover rule after the :link and :visited rules but before the :active one, as defined by the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active."><code>:hover</code></a></li>
    	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus" title="The :focus CSS pseudo-class is applied when an element has received focus, either from the user selecting it with the use of a keyboard or by activating with the mouse (e.g. a form input)."><code>:focus</code></a></li>

See :nth-child for a more thorough description of the syntax of its argument. This is a more flexible and useful pseudo selector if you want to ensure you're selecting the same type of tag no matter where it is inside the parent element, or what other different tags appear before it."><code>:nth-of-type</code></a></li>
