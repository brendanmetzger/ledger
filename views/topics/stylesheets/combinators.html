  <p>We are familiar with descendant selectors, something like <code>article section</code> will allow us to style all any section so long as it has an article as an <mark>ancestor</mark>. Much of the time, this can be more than we want, but luckily we can limit the reach of the descendant chain with the use of a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_selectors">Child Selector</a>. By simply changing our previous selector to <code>article &gt; section</code> we only select sections that are direct children of an article. If you’re not familiar with the difference between children and descendants yet, hit the books.</p>
  <p>While not as immediately useful, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_selectors">adjacent sibling selectors</a> can be utilized to apply classes based on if elements are directly next to each other. An example would be adding a top border all but the first element of a list with <code>li + li { border-top: 1px solid #000; }</code>. If say, you wanted all the paragraphs following the first one to have an indent, but couldn’t be sure that it would be only p tags, you could switch to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_selectors">general sibling selectors</a> and use a selector like <code> p ~ p { text-indent: 1em; }</code>.</p>
