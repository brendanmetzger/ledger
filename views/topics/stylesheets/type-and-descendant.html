  <h2>Selectors: <em>Type and Descendent</em></h2>
  <p>The most basic form of selectors are called <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors">type selectors</a> where you use the name of the specific element to target it. The snippit <code>p { <em>properties</em> }</code>, would select all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements; the snippit <code>body { <em>properties</em> }</code> would select all <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags (but remember, there is only one per document).</p>
  <p>Type selectors are typically very broad, but luckily we will learn to become infinitely precise using stylesheet syntax. The first way we'll add precision and specificity is through <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_selectors">descendant selection</a>. We are already understanding the role of an element as an object, and now we will enforce the relationship an element object has with other element objects. Just like a family relationship, a <em>descendant</em> implies hierarchyâ€”a hierarchy that we can even apply more specific language to, like parent, child, siblings and ancestor.</p>
