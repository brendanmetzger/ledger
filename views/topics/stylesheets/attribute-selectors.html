  <h2>Selecting by Attribute</h2>
  <h4>Selectors</h4>
  <p>Attribute <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors">selectors</a> offer us yet another dimension of targeting Elements. Essentially you use square brackets to inspect the presence, or even the value of a specified attribute. It will be important to understand the new syntax presented, as it is a good introduction to the style of syntax we use to execute programs.</p>
  <p>For some reading material, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors">here are the docs</a> on attribute selectors, or for a more visual explanation <a href="https://css-tricks.com/attribute-selectors/">check out this tutorial</a>. Attribute selectors pretty much round out our selection suite, which all together, looks something like this: Element &amp; descendant selectors, classes and IDs, children and sibling combinators, class chaining, and now attribute selectors. Both <abbr>css</abbr> and JavaScript employ these selection techniques.</p>

  <h4>Data</h4>
  <p><abbr>HTML</abbr> has a way to store data in an attribute. Interestingly, itâ€™s called a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_global_data.asp">data attribute</a>. Data attributes (well, all attributes) can be seen by the inspecting eyes of <abbr>css</abbr>, which is an introduction to attribute selectors. Likewise, data-attributes can be seen and set in very straight forward ways using object access methods (more on that to come), and this can be quite elegant. Within your <abbr>html</abbr>, you can simply add <code>&lt;p data-foo="bar"&gt;</code> where <strong>foo</strong> is the name of your custom attribute and <strong>bar</strong> is the value.</p>
  <p>The important takeaway here is twofold. You can make up an attribute to store data for later (hint, JavaScript), but you can also target that attribute with the a <abbr>css</abbr> selector.</p>
