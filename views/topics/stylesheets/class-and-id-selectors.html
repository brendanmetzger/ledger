  <h2>Selectors: <em>Classes, IDs, and pseudo classes</em></h2>
  <p class="intro">Now that we have some familiarity <abbr title="hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr> structure and how to take advantage of Element types and decendancy using <abbr title="cascading stylesheets">CSS</abbr>, we can take our first step towards naming things as we would prefer.</p>
  <p>Classes and IDs are added as attributes of an Element Node. Adding classes to elements is the most powerful ways to style a document if you are clever and/or careful. Adding IDs is less important for styling and more important for targeting a unique (that means only one) element—which is especially useful in JavaScript and XML.<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp">Pseudo-classes</a> are ways to style transient states, such as a user hovering over an element with <code>:hover</code>, or an element’s position in the hierarchy with <code>:first-child</code> They are called pseudo because you don’t add them, the browser kind of adds them for you when necessary.</p>
  <p>With <strong>well structured HTML</strong>, you need fewer elements to accomplish an elegant design through <abbr title="cascading stylesheet">CSS</abbr>—as opposed to sloppy <abbr title="HTML">HTML</abbr> that mandates many classes/ids and other selectors. For the professional developer, the less written, the easier it is to maintain code. To write less code, I believe in this general rule of thumb: if your CSS class doesn’t seem like it could apply to more than one element, rethink your approach. If your ID seems like it could apply to several things, you should rethink your approach. Lastly, when using ID selectors, only use them to add meaning, uniqueness, and specificity to your markup, and only use them to add style as a last resort or if you are feeling extremely lazy.</p>
  <h4 class="t">Usage of classes</h4>
  <p>You may add a class attribute to any Element Node like <code>&lt;elem class="name"&gt;</code>. Do note, you can add multilpe classes to an Element Node by specifying multiple names in the class attribute separated by whitespace, ie. <code>&lt;elem class="name1 name2 name3 …"&gt;</code>.</p>
  <p>To target a named class in a stylesheet, you simply use a period prefixed to the class name, such as <code>.name { …properties }</code>. If you want to specify that a rule only applies to an Element of a certain type, you can specify that by using the type selector in addition to the class selector, ie. <code>elem.classname { …properties }</code>.</p>
  <h4 class="t">Usage of ID’s</h4>
  <p>ID’s are very similar to classes except in a few significant ways. You add an ID attribute the same as a class, ie. <code>&lt;elem id="name"&gt;</code>. The two exceptions: an ID can <strong>never</strong> be used more than once in a document <span class="discuss">(why?)</span> and given that notion, you cannot add more than one ID to an element. If those points seem odd or meaningless to you, my beginner advice is avoid them until the meaning becomes necessary (which I find to be extremely rare by-the-way).</p>
  <p>To target an ID in your stylsheet, it’s just like css except you use an octothorpe (<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/octothorpe">pound sign</a>) instead of a period, ie. <code>#name { …properties }</code>.</p>
