  <h2>Introduction to Flexible Boxes</h2>
  <p class="intro"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes">From <abbr title="mozilla developer network">mdn</abbr></a>, flexbox is a <q>layout mode providing for the arrangement of elements on a page such that the elements behave predictably when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices.</q></p>
  <p>Flexible boxes are quite new but have reached a <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox">stable point</a> where they are safe to use in any project environment. Some find flexible boxes to be easier all aroundâ€”personally, for the most simple of matters I think they require a lot of nuanced skills, and thus I consider them as easy as float-based layouts. It is hard to argue that they make difficult layout problems much easier to solve, especially responsive layouts that must react to a variety of devices and resolutions. The defining aspect of a flexible box is its namesake; it gives an element the ability to alter height and width according to the specific display device used. It can expand and stretch and shrink <strong>without necessarily having to specify any units</strong>.</p>
  <p>For that reason, <a href="http://codepen.io/brendanmetzger/pen/JbraKv?editors=1100#0">as an introductory example</a> I will  showcase a most simple resolution of our classic grid problem using flexible boxes instead of floats. I will also throw in a caveat that the flexible box system can be a shortcut that unfortunately makes a lot of layouts generic, so if you take a liking to the methods available, realize that the <abbr>API</abbr> gets pretty deep as you try to add customization.</p>
