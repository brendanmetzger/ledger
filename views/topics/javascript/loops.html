  <p class="intro">Enumeration is a fancy way of counting, which is what computers excel at. Just like there are many ways to count, there are many ways to instruct a computer to do it.</p>
  <p>Rather than go through the de facto pattern of learning JavaScript, something banal like—<q>lets count to ten using a computer!!</q>—I'm going to expedite our focus to an intermediate-level inspection of loops. Starting with banal programs prevents us from thinking about counting in terms of practical problem solving opportunities. This means that you may need to go backwards and practice the beginner stuff on your own, which in truth is quite important to be familiar with.</p>

    <li><strong>Flow-of-control</strong>, or flow control is the order in which individual statements or function calls of a program are evaluated and/or executed.</li>
    <li><strong>A loop</strong> is a type of flow control concerned with repeating process, or <em>iteration</em></li>
    <li>When we are interested in manipulating anything that fits the description of <strong>more than one or once</strong>, a looping mechanism is employed</li>
  </ol>
  <p>With those rules in mind, especially the last one, lets concern ourselves with the notion of how we keep track of stuff. From my perspective in a classroom, I can address any single person individually, usually by finding some unique aspect that they possess (like a name), and address a message at them. To address the room, address everyone at the same time, but that is a human convenience. To think like a computer, I would have to consider a great many more things. The following is the thought process I might have if I was a computer trying to say hello to everyone in a room. As humans it's easier to understand that I'd just say it to everyone at the room at once, but computers can only execute one instruction at a time.</p>

        <p class="conversation">A room is... a list. Starting from 0, there are 14 people in this room for a length of 15. I want to say hello to everyone in the room. I'll start at person 0, is 0 less than 15? Yes. <q>Person 0, hello!</q>. Now that I'm finished with that, I will increment my mental bookmark by one, so 0 + 1 = 1. Is 1 less than 14, which is my total number of people? Yes. <q>Person number 1, hello!</q>. Change my bookmark, I was at 1. 1 + 1 = 2. 2 is less than 14? Yes. <q>Person 3, hello!</q> (and so on and so forth, until...) . <q>Person number 14, hello!</q> Update my bookmark; 14 + 1 = 15. Is 15 less than 14? No. I'm done saying hello to everyone.</p>

        <p>Admittedly, the process of writing all those numbers and doing all that adding is not rocket science, but it is incredibly easy to lose track of things, and even easier to make a typo. Another way of thinking about the problem is to consider it functionally.</p>
        <p>First, break apart the problem from <em>saying hello to everyone</em> to saying <em>saying hello to a person</em>. If we were to compose a routine, it might start with getting the name, and then once you have that running through the steps necessary to say hello—which in this case would be concatenating the word ‘hello’ to the name given. Thinking inductively, if that works for one person, given a list of people, we could apply that function to the entire list. Beautiful!</p>
        <p>The <code>forEach</code> function of an array facilitates this for us. It says <q>pass me a function, and I'll call that function for you.  For each item I see I'll call the function you gave me and pass the item as a parameter.</q></p>
