  <h2>Variable Scope</h2>
  <p>We can stylistically determine how something looks (as will as linguistically add meaning) through the hierarchy and structure of our outline, ie., a <code class="element">h2</code> is most important to its containing <code class="element">section</code> or <code class="element">article</code> element. We can do a similar thing our program code. Recalling <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html">Chapter 3</a> of <em>Eloquent JavaScript</em>, I mentioned that the material was a bit terse, so now we'll look a little closer.</p>
  <p>If I declare a function, it is not much different than declaring a variable. I pick out a name, and that name, gives me a way to assign and store some <em>value</em> for later use: strings, numbers, booleans, nulls, undefined, and objects (including arrays and functions). Where that variable declaration happens and how we gain access to it is the concept <strong>variable scope</strong>.</p>

      <h5>Variables must be declared somewhere.</h5>
      <p>When you write some code a compilation process takes looks at all of your declarations and converts them to program code. The outermost layer is called <em>the global scope</em>. At right, we have declared two things and added them to the global scope, what are they?</p>

      <h5>Global Scope vs. Local Scope</h5>
      <p>In the current version<sup>*</sup> of javascript, there is only one other type of scope available, called <em>local scope</em>. Local scope is created within the body of a function declaration. Spot the following: there are three variables declared, two in the global scope, one scoped to the <code>drive</code> function. The two <code>truck</code> variables share the <em>same name</em>, but they in <em>different scopes</em>, and thus, <em>different variables</em>.</p>

      <h5>Arguments and Parameters</h5>
      <p>Something we often forget about is the nature of declared arguments as a way to usurp the scope of a variable. Arguments are scoped to the function they belong. A correct way of thinking about arguments might be <code>function(var something)…</code> as we are declaring a variable to store whatever we pass in as a parameter. This is a good way of thinking about it, but never actually write var, it is a syntax error.</p>

      <h5>Nesting Scopes</h5>
      <p>Once again, functions are objects, and objects can contain other objects. Declaring a function is declaring a variable, and if we can declare a variable within a function, it would seem like we should be able to declare a function inside another function—and we can. The important thing to remember is that a function will always go up the scope chain, all the way to the global scope if necessary. It will stop whenever it finds a variable with the name it seeks, and if no variable can be found with that name, it will be an <em>undefined</em></p>
      <p>Spot the following: five variable declarations, three scopes. Practice spotting the difference between function <em>declaration</em> and function <em>execution</em> of a function.</p>
