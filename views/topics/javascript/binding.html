    <h5 class="tt">A double-entendre (and foray into function binding and closures)</h5>
    <p class="intro _______">I ran across an article called <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/getoutbindingsituations">Getting Out of Binding Situations in JavaScript</a> (written some years ago) and realized that programming how-to articles offer quite different—although cogent—perspectives.</p>
  </header>
  <section class="three columns dropcap">
    <p>Without perspective people become dogmatic and righteous and maybe even a tad confused, so before taking anything as gospel, let’s use the example I culled in that article do (quite literally) some <em>this vs. that</em>. I've noticed myself writing code a bit differently from many, and I realized it is probably because of philosophy I adopted from the frameworks and languages I was fascinated with years ago. My goal is not to pick anything apart, but to try and offer some insight into something that many people who are comfortable with JavaScript may have some trouble seeing.</p>
    <p>Let’s start right in with a tidbit of code—a classic two-pronged example about the foibles of scope, which anyone tinkering with advanced scripts will have run into at some point. Boiled way down, we have two similar pieces of code, starting with the left, the article informs us, <q>…such a “bound reference” requires us to wrap the original method within an anonymous function, which … results in two method calls: our anonymous wrapper, and the original method.</q> That is true, <code>bind</code> could be seen as a wrapper function, deceptively adding an extra call, but that was by choice, not necessity, as will be illustrated next.</p>

  <p class="margins">Glance below et voilà—look at the modified <code>bind</code> on the left and it now has an equivalent number of function calls. The original version (<abbr title="right hand side">RHS</abbr>), the author mentions how jQuery implements this philosophic principle on scope resolution for good reason; I will counterpoint that even if not preferred, I have a very different philosophy: <strong>if you are using <code>this</code>, keep it relevant.</strong></p>

  <h2>Examples are usually weird</h2>
  <p>I’m going to be a dilettante and announce that <code>Function.bind</code> was a brilliant addition to <abbr title="ecmascript version 5">ES5</abbr>, and this using frameworks that employed a prototypal method for <code>bind</code> (Prototype, MooTools), likely adopted this philosophy of doing business. Add to that most examples needed to illustrate some obscure point largely leave the reader with a gap in understanding the difference between functionality and author preference.</p>
  <p>Back to the article I read, for a beginner there are too many things to overlook, and I’ll pick at it a bit more because it does favor one solution over another (in terms of performance) and everybody always wants to be the best so that comes across as gospel. I am going to argue philosophy, because that seems just as interesting to me. Examine the following:</p>
  <section class="split whitepaper">
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums" title="markitem... will be undefined">
      this.items.forEach(function(item) {
        // typeError – dunno what `this` is..
        this.markItemAsProcessed(item);
      });
    </pre>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums" title="callback doesn't have to be anonymous">
      // `this` scope now resolves to one/same place
      this.items.forEach(this.markItemAsProcessed);
    </pre>
  </section>
  <p>I say making examples is super hard because a beginner might not see that it's just an example of using a    <em>closure</em> vs. <em>bind</em> and not a very good solution to an actual problem. In fact, my counterpoint to the previous example almost elucidates that. Going backwards a few steps, as you get a feel for scope resolution, you take bigger shortcuts. From the article, the only reason we need to mess with a closure/binding is because of the <strong>anonymous function</strong> in our <code>each</code> method. Reminder, in JavaScript (pre <abbr title="ecmascript version 6">es6</abbr> anyway), functions do and are used to change scope. Thus the <abbr title="left hand side">lhs</abbr> triggers an error that <code>markItemAsProcessed</code> is undefined that function changed the scope and changed the <code>this</code>. But wait! We never needed it in the first place, and this is no small thing—I think a majority of people writing JavaScript do not see that—maybe they are <mark>uncomfortable seeing functions without adjacent parentheses?</mark></p>
  <p>Leave off the parentheses and you can give a function to another function because it is yet-to-be-called, ahem,  <em>callback</em>. You don't really need to bind all that often, but it's an awesome thing to take advantage of every now and then. With <code>bind</code>, JavaScript functions are basically manipulating themselves into different functions—and from there you can do intriguing things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying">currying</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application">partial application</a> which are oddly fun mind-benders.</p>

      <h2>Functions beget functions: Way down to brass tacks</h2>
      <p><code>Array.forEach</code> is actually just a clever shortcut for folks who prefer the functional way of doing things and I think it is worth understanding fully. It is a function itself, and it takes a function—declared or anonymous—as the first argument. That <em>callback</em> function is called for every index the array and the value is passed to that function. That foils many, so lets unwind the process a bit further and be much more inefficient with things.</p>

        <p>Conceptually, we want to sing the <i>99 bottles of beer on the wall</i>—using only procedural functions. Step 1, make a function to sing the song, step two, run that function 99 times, until verse is 0 and we have no more bottles on the wall.</p>
        <hr class="ruled"/>
        <p>You may note, why not just use a loop. Sure, that would be better, but that's not the point here. I am only interested in functions and bigger ideas will come along soon enough.</p>

    <p>Glancing at the homemade version below reminds us that <code>Array.forEach</code> is itself a function, thus, <em>it has it’s own scope</em>, and because of that – and for for sake of simplicity – let’s just say that our callback will not have the scope that it had where <em>we wrote it</em> (lexical). Moreover, the brain and eyeballs we use to scan our program’s source code will no doubt have lost track of <q>lexical scope</q> by this point, so we stare cross-eyed at the nonsense in front of us, convinced that we messed something up. Rather than do that over and over, let’s right now make a pithy rule of thumb called the <strong>callback principle</strong>: functions, anonymous or otherwise, passed as arguments to other functions will have their scope mangled; it will elude you; it will trick your eyeballs; predict it happening before it foils you.</p>
    <p>Messing with the identity (<code>this</code>) of a function gives us something we’ll casually call <q>dynamic scope</q>. The ongoing goal of this essay is to highlight situations where you can use either closure (lexical) or binding (dynamic) scope and getting the difference betwixt the two. Programming is expressive and interesting, and the fact that JavaScript offers so many techniques makes it interesting—albeit a tad frustrating at first.</p>

  <h2>Beginner languages and <em>Lambda Abstractions</em></h2>
  <p>JavaScript is frustrating for many people, and I think it starts with the fact that instead of a slow and steady introduction to anonymous functions and closures – which are a bit more niche in other popular languages – one is thrust into that way of thinking right away through necessity of important JavaScript functions like <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>addEventListener</code>. Further, compared to tradition <abbr title="object oriented">oo</abbr> languages, <code>this</code> this works quite different from class-based definitions.  it can <em>and must</em> be manipulated to implement object-oriented JavaScript. <strong>Every scope has a <code>this</code> bound to some object; every function creates its own scope, and if not told otherwise, figures out what <code>this</code> represents</strong> based on where it was called from.</p>
  <h3>Elegance, is a virtue</h3>
  <p>In the examples to follow, we will assume that scope resolution is quite necessary. Referencing the code below, note that in the body of <code>markItemAsProcessed</code>, it requires access to its containing object via <code>this</code>; the object that defines and implements the <code>items</code> property and the <code>processItems</code> property (a function). Since we know what this object is, we should go ahead and use <code>this</code> and keep things <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling">loosly coupled</a>. In their entirety, these examples employ a list of items, and have a method that can 'process' them all at once, which in this instance, is pushing them into an <code>Array</code> called 'processed'. Here are two techniques, one using scoped variables, and the other binding <code>this</code>.</p>

  <p>Introducing <code>var that = this;</code> doesn’t do anything bad, but it <em>doesn’t</em> do something that the second version does, and something that I consider quite beneficial. First, it is not that there is one less step in the second example – that is not an advantage, nor should concision be a goal when writing elegant or maintainable code. I prefer the design thinking of the second one because of the introduction and consideration of [1] - which never has a clear spot to introduce itself in the first example – at least it didn’t to me. I was more focused on examining the scope/closure of my <em>anonymous function</em> than thinking about the context of <code>this</code> in my <em>entire object</em>.</p>
  <p>Further, swapping around <code><strong>that</strong>.doingSomething</code> is a bit of linguistic subterfuge – I prefer  to stay focused on <code><strong>this</strong>.doingSomething</code>. I think a reference to <code>this</code> is something you keep track of wholistically, whereas variable scope has a more myopic role; you literally need to see where things in the code are defined to put the pieces back together (by definiton of <em>lexical scope</em>). Now in a more opinionated fashion, using variables as references to <code>this</code> messes with my intuition regarding demonstrative pronouns, and choosing another variable name is all the same to me: <code><strong>(this|obj|super|whatever)</strong>.doingSomething</code> can’t trump the pristine focus of <code><strong>this</strong>.doingSomething</code> – as long as I stay mindful of what <code>this</code> is.</p>
  <h2>A working version</h2>
  <p>Below there are two exampleo of some code doing the exact same things. Output <code>item.processed === ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a']</code> and have the same interface. Output available in console.</p>
  <div class="split whitepaper">
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums" title="scoping 'that'">
      <!-- preview views/javascript/examples/binding-situations.js 34..59 -->
    </pre>
    <pre class="prettyprint linenums" title="binding 'this'">
      <!-- preview views/javascript/examples/binding-situations.js 62..86 -->
    </pre>
  </div>
  <p>My last note, even though both examples work, in the non-bind way, I got there by trial and error because I didn’t expect it to work the way it is written (ie, I was shoving more references to <code>that</code> in than I needed). This is a full concession to perhaps my weakness in understanding scope, but after calling <code>that.markItemAsProcessed</code> and then looking back into the actual <code>markItemAsProcessed</code> function definiton, I’m always a bit bemused to understand how it knows what <code>this</code> references. Then I look at it for awhile, and go "ohhhh! right…". Then I repeat my confusion a little later.</p>
  <h2>Regardless of technique</h2>
  <p>We can maintain scope through closures, or more appropriately <em>lexical scope</em>. This is a fancy way of saying, "where the code was written" or "determined at write time". Now, while I've heard that it’s not technically <em>dynamic scope</em>, setting <code>this</code> via <code>Function.bind</code> or <code>Functon.call</code> gets us kind of close to something like dynamic scope, and that is, scope that is determined "where the function was called", and in that way, it is "read time". Alternatively, in my loosest way possible, binding lets you mess around with functions that already exist… functions that maybe you didn’t even write! (example below)</p>
  <pre class="prettyprint">
    <!-- preview views/javascript/examples/binding-situations.js 102..106 -->
    <!-- preview views/javascript/examples/binding-situations.js 109..110 -->
  </pre>
  <p>Further into the weeds, timeouts are mind-benders when it comets to scope in general, and we almost always find it convenient (myself included) to create a function just to call <em>one</em> other function. Example of the traditional method below left, and by binding <code>DOMTokenList.add</code> as our function on the right. Assume a scoped variable called <code>$span</code> referencing an <code>Element</code> for both examples. <code>Element</code> has a prototype of <code>Node</code>, and it’s necessary to get a feel for prototypes when going hunting for functions we want to steal.</p>

  <h2>The takeaway</h2>
  <p>If you made it this far, I think I can sum up what everything with: <strong>if you are binding an anonymous function, you could probably find a more consise, albeit, somewhat abstreuse technique.</strong></p>
