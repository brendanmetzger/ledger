    <h2>Intro to JavaScript by means of Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The following quote is from <em>How To Design Programs</em> (<a href="http://www.htdp.org">freely available from <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr> Press</a>). While this book goes in in large detail about understanding the connection between mathematics and computing, and though that is not the subject of this course, it hits on a point you may hear me nag about.</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-11.html" class="two columns quote">
      <p>A programming language is in many ways like a spoken language. It has a vocabulary and a grammar. The vocabulary is the collection of those 'basic words' from which we can compose 'sentences' in our language. A sentence in a programming language is an expression or a function; the language’s grammar dictates how to form complete sentences from words. Programmers use the terminology <strong>syntax</strong> to refer to the vocabularies and grammars of programming languages.</p>
      <p>Not all grammatical sentences are meaningful—neither in English nor in a programming language. For example, the English sentence <q>the cat is round</q> is a meaningful sentence, but <q>the brick is a car</q> makes no sense, even though it is completely grammatical. <mark>To determine whether or not a sentence is meaningful, we must study the <strong>meaning</strong>, or <strong>semantics</strong>, of words and sentences.</mark> For spoken languages, we typically explain the meaning of words with sentences that use simpler words; in the case of a foreign language, we sometimes explain a word with simple sentences in the foreign language or we translate words to a known language. For programming languages, there are also several ways to explain the meaning of individual sentences.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The takeaway here is that learning syntax, though it might seem like an accomplishment, isn’t nearly as profound as it seems like (sorry). Just like learning to write <q>the cat is a brick</q> doesn’t make you an author, learning the vocabulary of a language is the starting point, so we must begin to get very comfortable with these concepts and using this new syntax to <em>design</em> outcomes.</p>
    <p>To begin learning JavaScript, below I’ve listed two data storage mechanisms utilized in the language. Just like <abbr>HTML</abbr> is a structure mechanism for data that we design with css, JavaScript employs methods to structure data so it can be retrieved and manipulated.</p>

    <section class="container margins">

      <h3>Objects</h3>
      <p class="container"><img src="/css/media/tackle.png" alt="card catalog" class="float left __" style="shape-outside:url(/css/media/tackle.png);shape-image-threshold:0.25;shape-margin:1em;" />As programs get more complex it becomes important to place data and behavior into structures that help organize and clarify our programs purpose. In JavaScript, objects provide an efficient means to store and utilize program components. They store a value associated with a property (often called a <em>key</em>). The structure is similar to the way we declare <abbr>CSS</abbr> properties with colon except in two very important ways: first, the value can be anything, including other objects (in stylesheets, the value is always a style definition) and second, the <code>property: value</code> is not terminated by a semi-colon. In fact, you do not need to terminate the line with anything unless you are declaring another property, in which case, you use a comma between them.</p>
      <p>While objects are very prominent in the JavaScript (essentially everything), it may aid you to first start thinking of objects as data structures so you can practice your ability to navigate them. Once you've mastered setting and accessing object properties, you’ll learn that they can actually be programmed to exhibit certain behaviors as well. You can assign an object to a named variable like <code>var example = {property: 'value'};</code> and access that property with <code>console.log(example.property);</code> using the <em>dot operator</em>.</p>

      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      <p><img src="/css/media/catalog.png" alt="card catalog" class="float right __" style="shape-outside:url(/css/media/catalog.png);shape-image-threshold:0.25;shape-margin:1em;"/>Arrays are <em>a special type of object</em> which maintain order. Instead of using strings as keys, they use integers, called indices.  Instead of using curly braces to declare them, you use square brackets. To access an item in an array, you use brackets along with the index you are interested in. Indices always start at 0. Beyond that, like an object, you can put anything you like in an array, including other arrays. While this might seem like less useful than an object at first glance,  in programming, order is <em>precisely what you want</em> making the array extremely useful and necessary type of object. An array is declared <code>var example = ['value'];</code>, and it is accessed <code>console.log(example[0]);</code> using the bracket operator.</p>

      <h4 class="ruled top t pad">Using Objects and Arrays to talk about data.</h4>
      <aside class="float left ____ note">
        <p>Brackets, both square and curly, are going to become extremely familiar to you by the end of the semester. Objects use curly brackets, arrays use square brackets—make sure you syntactically see the following structure.</p>
        <p>In my adjacent object definition, I have assigned an object to variable called refrigerator. That object has things called <strong>properties</strong>, and those properties have <strong>values</strong>. A value can be of any <strong>type</strong>—a number, string, boolean, even another object or array. Programmers in other languages really appreciate the JavaScript syntax for describing objects, because it is expressive, powerful and quite legible once you get the hang of it. As a reminder, we have been talking about objects since the very beginning with the <strong>Document Object</strong>; the concept centers around humans and machines exchanging structured data.</p>
        <p>Also my harping on structure should be clear at this point. Note that the indentation, the opening and closing of braces and brackets helps clarify the hierarchy.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The refrigerator object has several properties containing several types: string, number, boolean, and array.</li>
          <li><code>refrigerator.ice_maker</code> is a Boolean.</li>
          <li><code>refrigerator.shelves</code> is an Array containing Objects.</li>
          <li><code>refrigerator.drawers</code> is an Array containing Objects.</li>
          <li><code>refrigerator.shelves[1].contents[0]</code> is 'mayonnaise'</li>
        </ul>
