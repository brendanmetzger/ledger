    <h2>Intro to JavaScript Objects and Arrays</h2>
    <p>The following quote is from <em>How To Design Programs</em> (<a href="http://www.htdp.org">freely available from <abbr title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</abbr> Press</a>). While this book goes in in large detail about understanding the connection between mathematics and computing, and though that is not the subject of this course, it hits on a point you may hear me nag about.</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-11.html" class="two columns quote">
      <p>A programming language is in many ways like a spoken language. It has a vocabulary and a grammar. The vocabulary is the collection of those 'basic words' from which we can compose 'sentences' in our language. A sentence in a programming language is an expression or a function; the language’s grammar dictates how to form complete sentences from words. Programmers use the terminology <strong>syntax</strong> to refer to the vocabularies and grammars of programming languages.</p>
      <p>Not all grammatical sentences are meaningful—neither in English nor in a programming language. For example, the English sentence <q>the cat is round</q> is a meaningful sentence, but <q>the brick is a car</q> makes no sense, even though it is completely grammatical. <mark>To determine whether or not a sentence is meaningful, we must study the <strong>meaning</strong>, or <strong>semantics</strong>, of words and sentences.</mark> For spoken languages, we typically explain the meaning of words with sentences that use simpler words; in the case of a foreign language, we sometimes explain a word with simple sentences in the foreign language or we translate words to a known language. For programming languages, there are also several ways to explain the meaning of individual sentences.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The takeaway here is that learning syntax, though it might seem like an accomplishment, isn’t nearly as profound as it seems like (sorry). Just like learning to write <q>the cat is a brick</q> doesn’t make you an author, learning the vocabulary of a language is the starting point, so we must begin to get very comfortable with these concepts and using this new syntax to <em>design</em> outcomes.</p>
    <p>To begin learning JavaScript, below I’ve listed two data storage mechanisms utilized in the language. Just like <abbr>HTML</abbr> is a structure mechanism for data that we design with css, JavaScript employs methods to structure data so it can be retrieved and manipulated.</p>
    <hr class="ruled t b"/>
    <section class="container margins">
      <h3>Objects</h3>
      <p class="container"><img src="/css/media/tackle.png" alt="card catalog" class="float left __" style="shape-outside:url(/css/media/tackle.png);shape-image-threshold:0.25;shape-margin:1em;" />As programs get more complex it becomes important to place data and behavior into structures that help organize and clarify our programs purpose. In JavaScript, objects provide an efficient means to store and utilize program components. They store a value associated with a property (often called a <em>key</em>). The structure is similar to the way we declare <abbr>CSS</abbr> properties with colon except in two very important ways: first, the value can be anything, including other objects (in stylesheets, the value is always a style definition) and second, the <code>property: value</code> is not terminated by a semi-colon. In fact, you do not need to terminate the line with anything unless you are declaring another property, in which case, you use a comma between them.</p>
      <p>While objects are very prominent in the JavaScript (essentially everything), it may aid you to first start thinking of objects as data structures so you can practice your ability to navigate them. Once you've mastered setting and accessing object properties, you’ll learn that they can actually be programmed to exhibit certain behaviors as well. You can assign an object to a named variable like <code>var example = {property: 'value'};</code> and access that property with <code>console.log(example.property);</code> using the <em>dot operator</em>.</p>

      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      <p><img src="/css/media/catalog.png" alt="card catalog" class="float right __" style="shape-outside:url(/css/media/catalog.png);shape-image-threshold:0.25;shape-margin:1em;"/>Arrays are <em>a special type of object</em> which maintain order. Instead of using strings as keys, they use integers, called indices.  Instead of using curly braces to declare them, you use square brackets. To access an item in an array, you use brackets along with the index you are interested in. Indices always start at 0. Beyond that, like an object, you can put anything you like in an array, including other arrays. While this might seem like less useful than an object at first glance,  in programming, order is <em>precisely what you want</em> making the array extremely useful and necessary type of object. An array is declared <code>var example = ['value'];</code>, and it is accessed <code>console.log(example[0]);</code> using the bracket operator.</p>

        <h4>Using Objects and Arrays to talk about data.</h4>
        <p>With practice, <dfn id="dfn-delimiters">delimiters</dfn> become very recognizable; this is important, because one might contend that the <mark>vast majority of of syntax errors are a misplaced delimiter.</mark> </p>
        <p>In my adjacent object definition, I have made up an object (from thin air) and <dfn id="dfn-assignment">assigned</dfn> an object to variable. That object has things called <dfn id="dfn-properties">properties</dfn>, and those properties have <dfn id="dfn-value">values</dfn>. A value can be of any <dfn id="dfn-type">type</dfn>—a number, string, boolean, even another object or array or <dfn id="dfn-function">function</dfn>. Programmers in other languages really appreciate the JavaScript syntax for describing objects, because it is expressive, powerful and quite legible once you get the hang of it.</p>
        <p>When analyzing the example object, note the indentation, the opening and closing of braces and the use of commas. How one organizes all source code and syntax, in <em>any</em> language, matters a great deal.</p>
        <ol class="t">
          <li>What is the object named?</li>
          <li>How would one get the make? Is the answer a <dfn>string</dfn>?</li>
          <li>How many shelves are there? How would one get the mustard?</li>
          <li>How Many drawers?</li>
          <li>How would you describe the contents of the second drawer?</li>

        <li>A <a href="#dfn-delimiter">delimiter</a> is a sequence of characters that defines a boundary. The classic comma is a simple one that separates a set of things belonging to one group. Bracket delimiters, such as <samp>""</samp>, <samp>[]</samp>, <samp>''</samp>, <samp>()</samp> and <samp>{}</samp> mark the start and end of regions, and are often responsible for <em>defining</em> a group.</li>
        <li>An <a href="#dfn-assignment">assignment</a> is an <dfn>operation</dfn> that takes one value and assigns it to a place in memory. That place is given a name, either with the <code>var</code> keyword or in a <dfn>property</dfn> definition</li>
        <li>A <a href="#dfn-property">property</a> is the like a variable declaration for an object: it holds on to whatever you pass to it. Note, however, to <dfn>assign</dfn> a value to an object property, you use a colon (<samp>:</samp>), not an equal sign (<samp>=</samp>).</li>
        <li><a href="#dfn-value">values</a> are the actual contents of a variable or property. They can be any number of things, including nothing.</li>
        <li>A <a href="#dfn-type">type</a> is the finite number of things a variable or property can be. A <samp>string</samp> string is a group of characters delimited by a single or double quotation mark. There are also <samp>numbers</samp>, <samp>true</samp> and <samp>false</samp> which are known as <dfn>booleans</dfn>, and of course, <samp>objects</samp> and <samp>arrays</samp> (and a few more)</li>
        <li>The <a href="#dfn-function"></a> is another <dfn>type</dfn> that gets its own line because it is of paramount important in JavaScript. The function, described as broadly as possible, takes input, does any number of actions, and returns output.</li>
