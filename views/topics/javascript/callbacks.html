  <h2>Getting a <em>callback</em> (as in understanding)</h2>
  <p class="intro">You will learn syntax on your own given the practice—it’s actually very straightforward once you get over the unfamiliarity hurdle. Correctly writing programs isn’t really about syntax, it’s about abstracting ideas—and yes, I’ll admit, that is a bijillion times harder.</p>

      <p>Well known at this point is that functions are first <em>declared</em> and then <em>executed</em> (you may also hear it termed applying a function or calling a function). Sometimes we do the declaring, sometimes the language has defined functions for us, like <code>console.log</code>. Sometimes we take charge of executing a function in our code, sometimes the function is executed by something out of our control—perhaps when a certain event occurs.</p>
      <p>It is the latter method that is particularly interesting, which is simply a declared function passed as a parameter to another function. You must read and understand that notion: <mark>a function can be passed to another function</mark> and it is so important it has been given its own word to define the concept: a <strong>callback</strong>. Whenever you see or hear it, you know that one function expects another function as a parameter (the parameter being the callback). Commit this to memory!</p>
      <p>The function given the callback parameter determines when and how the callback function is executed; and right there, in a nutshell, is how JavaScript does it’s most profound business. This concept governs event-based programming, so if you are an interactive designer, this is where your world of design opens up to a new frontier.</p>
