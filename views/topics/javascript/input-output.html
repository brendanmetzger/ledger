  <h2>I/O: Arguments and Return Values</h2>
  <p class="indented">In all of the functions examples so far, we haven’t expected any input or returned any output. While this is sometimes useful, most of the time our function declarations will be more useful with the addition of passing <strong>arguments</strong>, and <strong>returning</strong> some type of output.</p>
  <p>Arguments, also known as parameters, are declared at <strong>compile-time</strong> and passed in at <strong>call time</strong> in terms of values. A <code>return</code> statement is placed at the end of a function, and it gives you something back. Just like some of the first mathematics we learned like <code>cos x</code>, a function takes some input and gives us some output. Unlike mathematics, functions in JavaScript don’t necessarily need input, and don’t necessarily provide output.</p>

      <p>Functions can have zero up to any number of arguments. Arguments can be named, or they can be accessed with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments"><code>arguments</code></a> object.</p>
      <p>Carefully study every example and think carefully about the following questions. In fact, generally do this review whenever introducing yourself to a function.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>What is the expected input?</li>
        <li>What variables are used, can be declared inside (or outside, see scope) the function?</li>
        <li>What other variables and objects are in play?</li>
        <li>What values does the function body <strong>mutate</strong>?</li>
        <li>What <strong>value</strong> will the function return after execution?</li>
      </ol>
