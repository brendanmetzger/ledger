  <h2>I/O: Arguments and Return Values</h2>
  <p class="indented">In all of the functions examples so far, we haven’t expected any input or returned any output. While this is sometimes useful, most of the time our function declarations will be more useful with the addition of passing <strong>arguments</strong>, and <strong>returning</strong> some type of output.</p>
  <p>Arguments, also known as parameters, are declared at <strong>compile-time</strong> and passed in at <strong>call time</strong> in terms of values. A <code>return</code> statement is placed at the end of a function, and it gives you something back. Just like some of the first mathematics we learned like <code>cos x</code>, a function takes some input and gives us some output. Unlike mathematics, functions in JavaScript don’t necessarily need input, and don’t necessarily provide output.</p>

      <p>Functions can have zero up to any number of arguments. Arguments can be named, or they can be accessed with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments"><code>arguments</code></a> object. Adjacent are several confusing functions</p>
      <h3 class="t b">Inspecting Functions</h3>
      <p><mark>Carefully study every example and think carefully about the following questions.</mark> In fact, generally do this review whenever introducing yourself to a function.</p>
      <ul class="stylized star tt">
        <li>What is the expected input—that is, what is named inside of the parentheses?</li>
        <li>Following the previous question, what are the arguments used for?</li>
        <li>What variables are used in the function? Are they declared within the function itself?</li>
        <li>What other variables and objects are in play? Do you understand their scope?</li>
        <li>Does the function rely on other functions?</li>
        <li>What <strong>value</strong> will the function return after execution?</li>
      </ul>
