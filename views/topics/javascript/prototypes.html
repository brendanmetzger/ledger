  <h2>Prototypes</h2>

  <p class="intro">JavaScript is a <em>prototypal language</em>, which is also known as class-less or instance-based programming. Unlike class-based languages that define relationships in a familial way (inheritance, parents, traits), prototypal languages share their genes by <em>cloning prototypes</em>.</p>
  <p>It is a rather peculiar concept, but objects have a property called the <code>prototype</code> and objects can copy each others prototypes. A fascinating (and sometimes dangerous) technique, is that because there are no classes, if you happen to change a prototype of an object, it changes the prototype or <em>all</em> objects that share itâ€”even if they existed long before the change was made.</p>

      <h5>A function as an object</h5>
      <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">Scalable Vector Graphics</a> are worth a look if you have not explored them yet. <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> is a popular library for data visualization, and <a href="http://snapsvg.io/">Snap</a> is another popular one for general purpose stuff, probably a bit easier to use. Both rely heavily on understanding their <abbr>api</abbr>s.</p>
      <p>This function constructor creates a new <abbr>SVG</abbr> interface that takes care of two of the most confusing concepts: adding new elements with the correct namespace and getting accurate mouse coordinates. While not well-documented, it can be read through in its entirety, thus the <abbr>api</abbr> is glean-able. The basic methods are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The constructor, which wants a parent container for the newly created <code>svg</code> Element, a height, and a width.</li>
        <li><code>createElement</code>, which wants a string for a tag name, the attributes as an object literal, and an optional node to embed in, defaulting to root svg element if none given.</li>
        <li><code>cursorPoint</code> can get the mouse coordinates if you are using events.</li>
        <li>regarding <abbr>css</abbr>, it will be useful to understand <a href="https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/interact.html#PointerEvents">pointer events</a></li>
