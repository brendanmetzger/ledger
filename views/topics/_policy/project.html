  <summary><h3>Project</h3></summary>
  <p><strong>Quick to start, slow to finish</strong> has been said to be the battle-cry of the procrastinator, but we're going to employ that idea to our advantage. Projects are a semester-long effort; they should reflect some interest of yours and together form a cohesive narrative—or, said another way—a website. Most students are ambitious about what they want to achieve, but often  get bogged way down in coming up with an idea, and then starting so late that mistakes and restarts consume 95% of the time given to the concept. The only way around that, and <mark>the only way to do well grade-wise, is to contribute work and ideas to your projects regularly.</mark></p>
  <h5 class="strong t">Grading</h5>
  <p>There will be two components of grading for each project. The first is a cold, calculated base level of performance. Did you write enough code? Does it validate? Did you meet the criteria provided with each outline? You have all semester to make sure those criteria are in check.</p>
  <p>The second component is a critique that I will do on (or shortly after) the due date. The critique is one time only, and I will grade things like code organization, concept, research, if you've documented your work appropriately, etc. I've designed the criterion to ensure that perfection—and this is important to me—is essentially impossible. Everybody has strengths and weaknesses and a critique is meant to expose both of them and give you an opportunity to adjust.</p>
