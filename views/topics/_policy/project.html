  <summary><h3>Project</h3></summary>
  <p>Projects are a semester-long effort; they should reflect some interest of yours and together form a cohesive narrative—or, said another way—a website. Many students are ambitious about what they want to achieve, but often  get bogged way down in coming up with an idea, and then starting so late that mistakes and restarts consume 95% of the time given to the concept. The only way around that, and <mark>the only way to do well grade-wise, is to contribute work and ideas to your projects regularly.</mark></p>
  <h5 class="strong t">Grading</h5>
  <p>There will be two components of grading for each project. The first is a cold, calculated base level of performance. Did you write enough code? Does it validate? Did you simply do <em>enough</em>. You have all semester to make the machine happy, and this will get more difficult the further behind you get.</p>
  <p>The second component is a critique that I will do on (or shortly after) the date specified. The critique is one-time-only; I will review things like concept, research, user experience, if you've documented your work appropriately, etc. The critique will be weighted for the entire class, and the score you are given sets the maximum grade you may receive, so to speak. That is to say, If I give you see a score of 93%, I'm saying <q>this project will earn a 93% if you do all of the work necessary.</q> Understand, even though the critique says you can get an 93%, you may only ever get up to a 78% if you don't complete the work.</p>
