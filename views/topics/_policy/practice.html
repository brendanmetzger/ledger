  <summary><h3>Practice</h3></summary>
  <p>Practice is where you make small gains on the necessary techniques. Practice is about fundamentals—like playing an instrument or learning the skills needed in sport—incremental gains eventually lead to mastery.</p>
  <h5 class="strong t">Grading</h5>
  <p>You must implement and adhere to a practice routine that accommodates your schedule. I have set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron task</a> which will scan your work on the <a href="http://iam.colum.edu/students/"><abbr title="interactive arts and media">iam</abbr> server</a> every night like a search engine. <mark>That means if you do some work, but forget to upload it, it will not be counted for practice that day, no exceptions.</mark></p>
  <p>I am only concerned with <abbr title="hypertext markupl language">html</abbr>, <abbr title="cascading stylesheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript and the README I have provided you in the templates. If updates are found, those updates will be tracked in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control</a> system to keep your changes organized. This type of software is designed to allow developers to track changes and view differences between files. In other words, do not pretend to practice for the points—you will earn a poor critique for pretend work.</p>
  <p>For every day you have done some work on a project a 'hit' will be recorded, up to 7 per week. I have a <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tkrwukosse">function set up</a>, much like an ease-in-out animation. One hit is worth almost nothing, but <mark>maintaining three to four hits per week is where you need to be</mark> if you are concerned about grades.</p>
