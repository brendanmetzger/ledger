  <summary><h3>Practice</h3></summary>
  <p>Practice is where you make small gains on the necessary techniques. Practice is about fundamentals—like playing an instrument or learning the skills needed in sport—incremental gains eventually lead to mastery.</p>
  <h5 class="strong t">Grading</h5>
  <p>Practice is on you, and you must maintain a practice routine that accommodates your schedule. I have set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron task</a> which will scan your work on the <a href="http://iam.colum.edu/students/"><abbr title="interactive arts and media">iam</abbr> server</a> every night like a search crawler. <mark>That means if you do some work, but forget to upload it, it will not be counted for practice that day.</mark></p>
  <p>I am only concerned with <abbr title="hypertext markupl language">html</abbr>, <abbr title="cascading stylesheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript I have provided you in the templates. After I find updates, I'll place them into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control">version control</a> system to keep your changes organized. This type of software is designed to allow developers to track changes and view differences between files. In other words, do not pretend to practice for the points—it will be obvious and it tells a story about your work ethic that may be worse than doing nothing.</p>
  <p>I have a <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tkrwukosse">function set up</a>, much like an ease-in-out animation. One commit is worth almost nothing, but maintain three to four per week and you will be great shape.</p>
