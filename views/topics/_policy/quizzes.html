  <summary><h3>Quizzes</h3></summary>
  <p>Quizzes will be low-stress (hopefully) as I am quite opposed to the concept of cramming. Simply, an opportunity to show you <em>usually pay attention</em>. The first quiz will be an exam, the second will likely be an essay on a topic of my choosing depending on how far along we get this semester.</p>
