    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p>There are two fundamental ways to draw using web technologies: using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API">canvas element</a> and with <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">Scalable Vector Graphics</a> referred to as <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>. To draw with the canvas element, you start with an html element called <code>canvas</code> and from there, you must use a JavaScript <abbr>API</abbr> to make shapes, set fill colors, etc. <abbr>SVG</abbr> on the other hand, is an <abbr>XML</abbr> file, and these files can be constructed by vector drawing programs like Adobe Illustrator, embedded as an image like any other format (<code>&lt;img src="file.svg"/&gt;</code>) or embedded directly into an HTML page as an <code>&lt;svg&gt;</code> element</p>
