  <h2>Nodes and their Attributes</h2>
  <p class="intro">An attribute is a quality that helps categorize any object. For instance, most individual humans have a <em>name</em>. The <em>value</em> of that name, once assigned, helps to define and represent the object. This could be codified say, with <code class="empty element">human name="Oprah"</code> where <i>human</i> is the object, <i>name</i> is an attribute, and <i>Oprah</i> is the value of it.</p>

  <p>The purpose of attributes are to store information about objects, largely so that when you need to examine them, find them, or interact with them they have special characteristics that can be utilized. Sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_attribute">attributes</a> are mandatory like the <samp>href</samp> in anchors—without them an anchor wouldn't know where to link to—in this way the <samp>href</samp> exhibits behavioral control. Attributes like <samp>class</samp> can be used to describe elements so they can be located in <abbr>css</abbr> selector declarations—a <samp>class</samp> provides a method of identification. The <samp>id</samp> attribute is perhaps the most misunderstood, in that it is used loosely as as a selector in a stylesheet. Identification attributes, like a social security number, represent identity. This is an important topic—you do not necessarily need to locate someone by <abbr title="social security number">ssn</abbr> when a combination of assets might work fine, like name and address.</p>
  <p>Syntactically, <mark>an attribute is always written on the opening tag of an element</mark> and is defined by specified keyword (meaning you don't make them up), then an = sign and a quoted string of text which usually the author is responsible for providing or naming. Back to our example  <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> (anchor) element, the <samp>href</samp> attribute (known as the hypertext reference) is a standard attribute and the value, supplied by the author, holds the location of a reference point (like another page).</p>
  <p><em>Attributes are an essential part of the vocabulary for describing documents</em>. Same attributes like <samp>href</samp> only apply to specific elements, while others are universal, in that we can apply them to any element. <abbr>html</abbr> even offers the facility to create your own attributes so long as they are prefixed with <samp>data-</samp> as in <code>&lt;p data-foo="bar"&gt;</code></p>
