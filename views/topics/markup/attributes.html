  <h2>Nodes Have Attributes</h2>
  <p class="intro">An attribute is a quality that helps categorize any object. For instance, most individual humans have a <em>name</em>. The <em>value</em> of the name is assigned together help define and represent the object. This could be codified say, with <samp class="prettyprint">&lt;human name="bob"/&gt;</samp> where <i>human</i> is the object, <i>name</i> is a attribute, and <i>bob</i> is the value of it.</p>

  <p>The purpose of attributes are to store information about objects, largely so that when you need to examine them, find them, or interact with them they have special characteristics that can be utilized. Sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_attribute">attributes</a> are mandatory like the <samp>href</samp> in anchors—without them an anchor wouldn't know where to link to—in this way the <samp>href</samp> exhibits behavioral control. Attributes like <samp>class</samp> can be used to describe elements so they can be located in <abbr>css</abbr> selector declarations—a <samp>class</samp> provides a method of identification.</p>
  <p>Syntactically, <mark>an attribute is always written on the opening tag of an element</mark> and is defined by specified keyword (meaning you don't make them up), then an = sign and a quoted string of text which usually the author is responsible for providing or naming. Back to our example  <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> (anchor) element, the <samp>href</samp> attribute (known as the hypertext reference) is a standard attribute and the value is supplied by the author as the resource to direct the user to.</p>
  <p><em>Attributes are now an essential part of our vocabulary</em> as we will be learning and using new ones throughout the semester. Attributes like href only apply to specific elements, while others are universal, in that we can apply them to any element. <abbr>html</abbr> even offers the facility to create your own attributes so long as they are prefixed with <samp>data-</samp> as in <code>&lt;p data-foo="bar"&gt;</code></p>
