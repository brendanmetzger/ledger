  <h2>From node to <abbr title="hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr></h2>
  <p>Your template files is full of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_(text)">boilerplate</a> that might seem like a formality, but it’s important to start understanding that <strong>marking up a document</strong> using a hierarchy of nodes is about explicity structure and meaning—not about style in the least. This serves two purposes: first to ensure a machine can parse the data, and second, to create objects that you can manipulate. We can change the <strong>look and feel</strong> of these objects through the use of a stylesheet language, and we can change the <strong>behavior</strong> of these objects through the use of a programming language. The nodes (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">html</abbr>) give structure and proper structure allows for powerful design and behavior modification. Perhaps unfortunately due to it’s easiness to learn and write, sloppy and incorrect markup is quite easy to get away with so you should be extra careful to understand it conceptually so you can take advantage of the powerful tools it will provide as we learn more about controlling look/feel and behavior of applications.</p>
  <p>The first clue that gives credence to the importance of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents is this boilerplate—something that many developers, at best, neglect, and at worst, never truly learn. Every <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">html</abbr> file will be saved with a .html extension and will contain the following elements: <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>. No other files we author requires such boilerplate; obviously it’s there for a reason or we'd skip it! With that, we are going to look at markup from a very high level, and investigate the concept of what a <q>node</q> is, and then apply that concept to authoring documents.</p>
  <p>Our first step away from thinking about markup as an aribtrary series of symbols and letters and start try very hard to think of <strong><abbr title="hypertext markup language">HTML</abbr> elements as actual objects</strong>.</p>
