  <h2>Attitude</h2>
  <div class="two columns indented dropcap">
    <p>There is a lot of material to cover in this course, and though it is not rocket science, it may be burdensome at times. In fact, I sympathize with you—it is quite difficult to organize all the material we cover and keep track of everything we are supposed to learn. We will all be running on empty by the end of the semester, but, come that time I hope we will all be proud of what we have accomplished.</p>
    <p>I say this constantly, but I can’t say it enough; effort counts for a great deal in life, but only if you're not discouraged that easily. Put another way, if you think you will not learn the material but are convinced you are trying hard, then the truth is you will never learn the material no matter how hard you try. I’m here to reinforce that one’s attitude matters; the material is not too hard, everyone has the same potential, but some never give themselves the chance to be successful, and others do not encourage their peers along the way.</p>
    <p>College is too expensive to take for granted. Sure, the modern world is full of conveniences and typing odd syntax and learning to program demands more brain energy than you <del>have</del> are willing to spare sometimes. Half-assing it is something we are all guilty of now and then but if you know you have a habit of abandoning hard work, lets abandon that habit starting… right… now.</p>
    <p><strong>For the student who thinks they know too little</strong>: first, you are very very wrong—start believing in yourself. I'll give you fourteen weeks of belief that you can accomplish the tasks I present, so please give yourself the same. <strong>For the student who knows too much:</strong> sheesh… I don’t know where to begin. I can say without any cynicism, those who think they can’t, won’t, and those who think they know the most in the beginning sometimes know the least in the end. All of this comes down to attitude, and your attitude stretches far beyond your time in the classroom with me.</p>
