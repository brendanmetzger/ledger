  <h2>Design Thinking</h2>
  <section class="three columns outdented ruled">
    <p>Designers, programmers, mathematicians, and artists all fancy themselves some sort of special breed of thinker. Designers have this gift of intuition and solving the tangible, programmers will efficiently solve any problem in the most efficient way, mathematicians dive into the limits of the known, and artists push the boundaries of what can be expressed. The glut of literature (ahem, blogs) written by individuals championing their craft would seem to indicate this anyway, and in my own moment of opining, I consider such beliefs largely arrogant or naïve.</p>
    <p>Part of my own struggle with design, programming, mathematics and artistry is a dogged pursuit of <dfn>clairvoyance</dfn>, that is, letting the things in my mind be expressed in a way that is thoughtful, unique and wholly intentional. Architecture is an interesting profession that takes design, art, math and programming <em>so fucking seriously</em>, is so ancient an necessary to our wellbeing, and one of the few places where we as humans still treat <dfn>craft</dfn> so earnestly. Fascinating to me, young people are quite literally not allowed to be exceptional architects; they must apprentice, study, be gainfully employed and be tested early in their career before beginning an independent practice. While this seems about to be an anthem on architecture, I assure you it’s not; it is about my personal, steadfast belief in the principles of <dfn>craft</dfn>.</p>

    <p>Design is not making beauty; beauty emerges from selection, affinities, integration, love.</p>

    <p>Designers and their gift of aesthetic intuition: <em>bullshit</em>. Programmers and their gift of efficient optimization: <em>often laziness masked as efficiency</em>. Mathematicians flying the flag of abstract, novel thought: mathematics is perhaps the most maligned, <em>often dogmatic, rote efforts</em> of any curriculum. And in summation, this notion of the typecast artist some special idiosyncratic individual <em>drives me bananas</em>.</p>
    <p>So now that I’m opining, I should express my pedigree, because like all opinions, it is deeply biased against my own experiences. Academically, my studies can be broken into blocks of obsessive fascination followed by overwhelming self-doubt: Architecture, Computer Science, Architecture again, Interactive Art &amp; Design and ending with Mathematics. Professionally, I have only worked as an interactive designer and programmer.</p>

    <li>Design is the dogged and rigorous pursuit of <em>something ideal</em>. A great designer, by logical definition, should never consider themselves achieving their goal.</li>
    <li>A great programmer should look at a program and syntax the way a carpenter would look at a chisel. You'll know a shitty carpenter by the fact that they build one thing one time, consider it perfect, and talk about their chisel all day.</li>
    <li>Let’s be clear that the pure joy of mathematics comes from embracing abstraction, and in that way, it goes the farthest down the rabbit hole of what exactly it means to be human.</li>
    <li>Artistry is not an occupation. It is simply an adjacent word describing the transcendence that can take place in occupation involving craft</li>
