  <h1 class="massive">It is known</h1>
  <p class="intro">For the quiz, you will write an essay. Imagine whatever grade you want for yourself (for this quiz), and if you had to write a pitch for that score in words, what road would you take to show me. This is not a competitive act, but a chance for you to reflect and share your successes and failures.</p>
  <h2>Cover the Material</h2>
  <p>I've written many outlines, provided links, did in-class examples: <strong>talk about the material and concepts that sunk in</strong> (or didn’t). The material you choose to write about must be original, that is, when discussing your successes and struggles, do your best to ensure these successes and struggles are <strong>yours</strong> and not generic to any situation or student experience.</p>
  <h2>Length</h2>
  <p>Try to keep your insights to no more than a page—based on the quantity available to share, that may be challenging to keep within that limit, so outline wisely. What you have to say will be evaluated in the context of what your peers have said, so embrace the responsibility to demonstrate your individual work ethic and perspective. To keep the limit down, discuss only topics you feel you gained the most experience in and those that challenged you the most, and again, discuss this material with <strong>concrete examples</strong>.</p>
  <h2>Grading</h2>
  <p>This evaluation will grant everyone the opportunity to do well, but it will still be evaluated carefully. I won’t neglect to mention that <strong>grammar, clarity, professionalism, and general style of writing</strong> are always important. I expect the agency of someone who has spent time with this material, and the ability to show that will be measured by me. As someone who has read all your source code, reviewed your projects, taken attendance and surveyed the room for 13 weeks, the veracity (truthfulness) of your essay will be familiar to me, so your personal and honest assessment of effort regarding course material, practice, and success will be determined by a direct comparison to what I see and what you tell me.</p>
