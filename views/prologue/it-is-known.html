  <h1 class="massive">It is known</h1>
  <p class="intro">For the quiz, you will write an essay; a self-evaluation type of essay. Imagine whatever grade you want for yourself, and if you had to defend that score in words, how would you begin. This is not a competitive act, but a <em>chance for reflection</em>.</p>
  <h2>Material</h2>
  <p>I've written many outlines, provided links, did in-class examples: <strong>illustrate the bits and pieces of material that sunk in.</strong>. The material you choose to write about must be original, that is, if you are outlining your successes and struggles, <strong>do your best to ensure these struggles are not generic to any situation and student experience</strong>.</p>
  <h2>Length</h2>
  <p>Here is what I'm expecting. It should be less than a page, and based on the ideas and material I'm expecting you to share, that should be moderately challenging to keep your insights within that limit. What you have to say will be evaluated in the context of what your peers have to say, so embrace the responsibility to demonstrate your individual work ethic and perspective. Be excited about the opportunity to choose the topics you feel you gained the most experience in and discuss the material.</p>
  <h2>Grading</h2>
  <p>This evaluation will give everyone a great opportunity to do well, but it will still be evaluated with some rigor. Several criteria will be used, starting with <strong>Grammar, clarity, professionalism, and general style of writing</strong>. I expect agency of a learner: criticism is quite welcome, but don't treat this like a comment card. I will critique your self-defined  <strong>review of the course material, progress, goals and ultimately how you well you did.</strong>. As someone who has read all your source code, reviewed your projects, taken attendance and surveyed the room for 13 weeks, the veracity (truthfulness) of your essay will be quite familiar to me.</p>
